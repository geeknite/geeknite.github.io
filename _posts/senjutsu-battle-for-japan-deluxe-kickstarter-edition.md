## Gameplay

### Setting Up

Setting up Senjutsu is like preparing for a battle worthy of song. Lay out the board, distribute cards, and position your miniatures. As you do, you might hear the whisper of ancient warriors urging you to victory or at least to not embarrass yourself.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players draw cards and use them to perform actions such as moving, attacking, or using special abilities. Strategy is key, as you'll need to anticipate your opponent's moves and outwit them. Remember, dishonor is worse than defeat.

### Combat

Combat in Senjutsu is a blend of strategic planning and luck. Each attack can be modified by drawing cards from your combat deck. Did your epic sword strike miss because you drew the "slipped on a rice grain" card? Welcome to the unpredictable world of Senjutsu.

### Environmental Sustainability

Another major theme is environmental sustainability. The authors envision a world where humans live in harmony with nature. This includes adopting renewable energy sources, reducing waste, and preserving natural habitats. Think of it as living in the Shire from Lord of the Rings but with solar panels and electric cars.

### Technological Advancements

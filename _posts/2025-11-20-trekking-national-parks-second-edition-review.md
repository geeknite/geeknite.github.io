## Game Overview

**Trekking The National Parks: The Board Game - Second Edition** is a family-friendly board game designed by Charlie Bink and published by Underdog Games. It’s inspired by the award-winning book "Trekking the National Parks" by the Bink family. This game allows players to explore different national parks, collect trail stones, and earn points by completing various objectives. With beautiful artwork and engaging mechanics, it’s a game that appeals to both casual players and hardcore board gamers.

### Components

The game comes with a stunningly illustrated board depicting the United States' national parks, a set of colorful player pawns, custom dice, park cards, and trekking cards. The component quality is top-notch, making you feel like you’re holding a piece of nature in your hands. The second edition has improved artwork, more durable components, and refined rules to enhance the gaming experience.

**Fun Fact**: The game includes a miniature of the Bink family’s dog, which can be used as a token in the game. Talk about a fur-tastic addition!

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up the game is a breeze. Lay out the board, distribute player pawns, and shuffle the park and trekking cards. Each player starts with a hand of trekking cards and a few trail stones. Place the first park cards on the board and you’re ready to embark on your adventure!

### Turns and Actions

On their turn, players can move their pawns across the map, draw trekking cards, and visit national parks. The goal is to collect park cards and trail stones to score points. Each park card has unique requirements that players must fulfill, such as visiting specific park locations or collecting certain types of cards.

**Pro Tip**: Keep an eye on your opponents' movements. They might be heading to the same park as you, and nothing stings more than being out-trekked by Grandma!

Join me on this hilarious yet informative journey as we explore the pros, cons, and quirks of the Meta Quest 3.

## The Good, The Bad, and The Virtual Reality

### The Good

2. **Price**: The Meta Quest 3 is one of the pricier VR headsets on the market. But hey, you get what you pay for - a ticket to the multiverse.

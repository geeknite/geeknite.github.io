**Hello Geeknite readers!** Today, we're diving into the deep, dark abyss that is Citadel Shade: Berserker Bloodshade. If you’re looking for the perfect shade to give your miniatures that menacing, blood-soaked look, then this shade is dripping with potential. Let’s dive in and see if this shade will leave your models looking like they’ve just emerged from the battlefield or like they've been dipped in ketchup. 

## **What is Citadel Shade: Berserker Bloodshade?**

Citadel Shades are washes designed to add depth and shadow to your miniatures. Berserker Bloodshade is a rich, dark red that promises to add a sinister, blood-soaked effect to your models. Ideal for painting wounds, gore, and other grim details that can make your miniatures stand out. 

## **Application**

Applying Berserker Bloodshade is as easy as pie. Just grab your brush, dip it into the pot, and slather it onto your miniature. The shade will flow into the recesses, creating natural shadows and depth. But be warned! Like all washes, it can pool and look messy if you’re not careful. 

### **Tips for Application**

1. **Less is More**: Don’t overload your brush. A little goes a long way!
2. **Go with the Flow**: Let gravity do its work. Apply the shade and let it settle into the recesses.
3. **Blot Away Excess**: If you see pooling, blot it away with a dry brush or tissue.

## **Results: The Good, The Bad, and The Bloody**

### **The Good**

Berserker Bloodshade creates a terrifyingly realistic blood effect. Perfect for wounds, weapons, and anything that needs a touch of horror. It’s great for adding shadow and depth to red or crimson areas, making them look more vibrant and alive (or dead, depending on your model).

### **The Bad**

If you’re not careful, it can look like your miniature has just emerged from a tomato fight. Pooling can be an issue, so make sure to apply it in thin layers. Also, it can stain lighter colors, so be cautious if you’re working on a model with a lot of whites or pastels.

### **The Bloody**

When used correctly, Berserker Bloodshade can make your miniatures look like they’ve been through the wringer. It’s perfect for adding that extra bit of gore and horror to your models, making them truly stand out on the battlefield.

## **Conclusion**

Citadel Shade: Berserker Bloodshade is a fantastic tool for miniature painters looking to add realistic blood effects to their models. While it requires careful application to avoid unwanted pooling and staining, the results are worth the effort. Your miniatures will look horrifyingly realistic, perfect for terrifying your opponents or impressing your fellow hobbyists.

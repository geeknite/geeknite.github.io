## The Basics

### What is Battleground FW: Undead Army Starter Deck?

The deck comes with beautifully illustrated cards, tokens, and a rulebook. The artwork is so detailed that you might start believing in zombies (just don't let them near your brain). The tokens are used to track various effects and status changes during the game.

**Pro Tip**: Keep the rulebook handy. You'll need it to settle disputes when your skeletons start arguing over who gets to eat the brains.

## Gameplay

### Combat

Combat in Battleground FW is a blend of strategy and luck. Each attack can be modified by drawing cards from your deck. Did you plan an epic attack only to draw a card that weakened your minions? Welcome to the world of the undead, where even the best-laid plans can go awry.

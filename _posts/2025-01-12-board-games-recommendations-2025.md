## Top Racing Board Games

### 1. [HEAT: Pedal to the Metal]({{ site.constants.wsib }}heat-pedal-to-the-metal)

HEAT: Pedal to the Metal is all about managing the heat in your car and using cards to outmaneuver opponents. It's fun and challenging. Just remember, too much heat and you'll be out of the race! This game is my absolute favorite, offering intense strategic depth and excitement in every race.

**Expansion Alert:** The Turbo expansion adds new cards and strategies, making the game even more intense. Can you handle the heat?

### 2. [Flamme Rouge]({{ site.constants.wsib }}flamme-rouge)

Flamme Rouge simulates a bicycle race, with players managing their energy levels and drafting behind other racers to gain an advantage. It's one of the standout racing games. Just don't forget to hydrate - even cardboard cyclists need water breaks! This game is my second favorite due to its unique mechanics and thrilling gameplay.

**Expansion Alert:** The Peloton expansion introduces new riders and tactics, while the Meteo expansion adds weather conditions that can change the course of the race. Rain or shine, the race must go on!

### 3. [Rallyman GT]({{ site.constants.wsib }}rallyman-gt)

Rallyman GT focuses on rally racing, with players navigating treacherous courses in powerful sports cars. It's perfect for anyone looking for skill and strategy.

**Expansion Alert:** The Championship expansion adds new tracks and rules for a full rally championship experience. Are you ready to take on the challenge?

### 4. [Formula D]({{ site.constants.wsib }}formula-d)

Formula D is a game that simulates the high-stakes world of Formula 1 racing. Each player takes on the role of a driver and must race their car around a track, trying to be the first to cross the finish line. And if you think you're fast, just wait until you roll a 1 on the dice!

**Expansion Alert:** Check out the various track expansions for Formula D, which add new challenges and excitement to your races. From the streets of Monaco to the treacherous corners of Singapore, there's always a new track to master.

### 5. [Downforce]({{ site.constants.wsib }}downforce)

Downforce is a racing game with a twist - players must not only race their cars but also bid on the ones they think will win. It's a race to the finish line and the bank. Just remember, betting on yourself is only cool if you actually win!

**Expansion Alert:** The Danger Circuit expansion adds two new tracks and new rules, making the game even more thrilling. Will you take the risk and come out on top?

### 6. [Thunder Road Vendetta]({{ site.constants.wsib }}thunder-road-vendetta)

Thunder Road Vendetta combines racing with survival in a post-apocalyptic world. It's sure to keep you entertained for hours. Just watch out for those road warriors - they play dirty! This game is my sixth favorite for its unique blend of racing and survival elements.

**Expansion Alert:** The Road Warriors expansion adds new vehicles and challenges, making the game even more chaotic. Are you ready to survive the apocalypse?

### 7. [Thunder Alley]({{ site.constants.wsib }}thunder-alley)

Camel Up is a lighthearted racing game where players bet on which camel will win a race around the track. It's great for anyone looking for an easy yet exciting game. And remember, camels may be slow, but they sure know how to make a race interesting!

**Expansion Alert:** The Supercup expansion adds new modules to the game, including new race tracks and betting options. Make your bet and hope your camel doesn't go on a lunch break!

### 9. [D-Day Dice]({{ site.constants.wsib }}d-day-dice)

D-Day Dice is a cooperative game where players represent soldiers storming the beaches of Normandy. While it’s more of a strategy game than a traditional racer, the urgency and teamwork required keep the adrenaline pumping. Roll your dice, gather resources, and move your units strategically to survive. This game makes its debut on our list due to the thrilling, heart-pounding experience it offers.

**Expansion Alert:** The Path to Hell expansion adds new scenarios and components, enhancing the overall experience. Can you survive the new challenges?

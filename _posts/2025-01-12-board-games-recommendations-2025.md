Formula D is a game that simulates the high-stakes world of Formula 1 racing. Each player takes on the role of a driver and must race their car around a track, trying to be the first to cross the finish line. And if you think you're fast, just wait until you roll a 1 on the dice!

**Expansion Alert:** Check out the various track expansions for Formula D, which add new challenges and excitement to your races. From the streets of Monaco to the treacherous corners of Singapore, there's always a new track to master.

### 5. [Downforce]({{ site.constants.wsib }}downforce)

Downforce is a racing game with a twist - players must not only race their cars but also bid on the ones they think will win. It's a race to the finish line and the bank. Just remember, betting on yourself is only cool if you actually win!

**Expansion Alert:** The Danger Circuit expansion adds two new tracks and new rules, making the game even more thrilling. Will you take the risk and come out on top?

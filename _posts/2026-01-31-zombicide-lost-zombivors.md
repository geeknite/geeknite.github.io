## What is Zombicide: Lost Zombivors?

Zombicide: Lost Zombivors is a cooperative board game where players take on the roles of survivors in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by zombies. Designed by Nicolas Raoult, Jean-Baptiste Lullien, and Raphaël Guiton, this game offers intense action, strategic gameplay, and plenty of humor. The twist?

### The Basics

In Zombicide: Lost Zombivors, players work together to complete missions, fend off zombie hordes, and survive the apocalypse. Each player controls a unique character with special abilities and equipment. The goal is simple: Stay alive and complete mission objectives. But beware, if you fall, you might come back as a zombivor—an undead version of your former self, still trying to complete the mission.

### Components

The game comes with:
- **Miniatures**: Detailed miniatures of survivors, zombivors, and various zombie types. They're so well-crafted you'll want to display them proudly—or maybe use them to startle your friends.
- **Cards**: Equipment, skills, and zombie spawn cards that add variety and unpredictability to each game.
- **Game Board**: Modular tiles representing different locations, ensuring endless replayability and unique setups.
- **Tokens and Markers**: Used to track progress, health, and various effects during the game.

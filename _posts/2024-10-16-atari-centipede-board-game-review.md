If you spent countless hours blasting bugs in the arcade, this board game adaptation is your ticket to reliving the glory days.

## The Basics

### What is Atari Centipede Board Game?

The Atari Centipede Board Game is a strategic adaptation of the classic arcade game, Centipede. Designed by Jon Gilmore and published by IDW Games, this game captures the essence of the original, allowing players to engage in bug-blasting action right at their tabletop. One player takes on the role of the heroic gardener, while others control the creepy-crawly centipede and its insect allies.

### Components

The game comes with a beautifully designed board, depicting a garden infested with various bugs, and high-quality miniatures, representing both the gardener and the insects. The detailed artwork and sturdy components ensure an immersive gaming experience. Additionally, the game includes various tokens, cards, and a rulebook that's surprisingly easy to understand – a rare gem in the board gaming world.

## Gameplay

### Setting Up

Setup is straightforward. The gardener player positions their avatar on the board, while the centipede player sets up the centipede segments and insect allies. The objective for the gardener is to eliminate the centipede before it reaches the garden, while the centipede player aims to reach the garden and cause havoc.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, the gardener moves across the board, using various actions to blast bugs, create barriers, and avoid getting overrun. The centipede player moves and spawns new insects based on limited information, trying to outmaneuver the gardener and wreak havoc.

### Strategy and Nostalgia

The game shines in its strategic depth. As the gardener, you must carefully plan your moves, utilize your blaster, and think several steps ahead to outwit the centipede and its allies. For the centipede player, cooperation and chaos are key. You'll need to coordinate your bugs effectively, exploit weaknesses, and anticipate the gardener's tactics to win.

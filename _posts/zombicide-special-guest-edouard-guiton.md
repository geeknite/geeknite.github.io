## Introduction

Hello, fellow gamers and zombie enthusiasts! Are you ready to dive into a world where the undead rule and heroes drool? Well, you better be because we're about to take a hilarious and thrilling journey through **Zombicide Special Guest: Edouard Guiton**, the board game expansion that combines strategy, survival, and an unhealthy amount of zombies!

## The Basics of Zombicide Special Guest: Edouard Guiton

Zombicide Special Guest: Edouard Guiton is a cooperative board game expansion designed for 1-6 players. The game revolves around surviving waves of zombie invasions while completing various objectives to save humanity. Think of it as "Zombieland" meets "Shaun of the Dead," but without the need for a cricket bat.

### Components

The expansion comes with beautifully designed miniatures featuring various heroes and zombies, including special guest characters by Edouard Guiton. The components include hero characters, zombie miniatures, and a deck of cards with events, items, and objectives. The artwork is top-notch, and you'll find yourself marveling at the creepy-crawly details.

**Fun Fact**: The game includes a special "Zombie Clown" miniature that will make you scream "NOT THE CLOWNS!" every time it appears.

## Gameplay

Zombicide Special Guest: Edouard Guiton is all about strategy, teamwork, and occasional screaming. Players must work together to complete objectives while fending off zombie mobs. Each player takes on the role of a hero with unique abilities, ranging from the "Chainsaw Maniac" to the "Silent Sniper."

### Turn Phases

Each turn consists of several phases:

1. **Action Phase**: Players perform actions like moving, attacking, and using special abilities.
2. **Event Phase**: Draw event cards that introduce new challenges or spawn more zombies. (Because why not?)
3. **Zombie Phase**: Zombies move and attack. Prepare for chaos!

### Winning and Losing

To win, players must complete all objectives before the zombie invasion becomes too overwhelming. If the heroes are defeated or the zombie infestation reaches critical levels, it's game over. Sorry, humanity.

**Pro Tip**: Always keep the "Molotov Cocktail" card handy. It may not save you, but it will give you a fighting chance.

## Zombicide Special Guest: The Humor Factor

One of the best aspects of Zombicide Special Guest: Edouard Guiton is the humor built into the gameplay. From the ridiculous event cards to the over-the-top hero abilities, there's never a dull moment. The game embraces the absurdity of a zombie apocalypse, and you'll find yourself laughing as much as strategizing.

**Funny Moment**: During one game, our "Silent Sniper" hero tried to negotiate with the Zombie Clown using a "Peace Treaty" card. Needless to say, it didn't go well. The laughter echoed for hours.

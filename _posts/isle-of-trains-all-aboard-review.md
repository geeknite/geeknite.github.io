## All Aboard the Isle of Trains Express!

Welcome, fellow board game enthusiasts! Today, we're taking a delightful journey through the whimsical world of **Isle of Trains: All Aboard (Kickstarter Edition)**. If you've been following our [comprehensive board games coverage]({%- post_url 2025-01-12-board-games-recommendations-2025 -%}), you'll know that we're no strangers to train games. But does Isle of Trains stand out on the crowded tracks or is it just another caboose? Let's find out!

As someone who spends more time on board games than actual trains (thanks, public transport!), I can assure you that Isle of Trains offers something refreshingly unique. It's a game about building, delivering, and competing in the most charmingly chaotic way possible.

## The Basics: Setting Up Your Railway Empire

Isle of Trains is a card game where players build trains and complete delivery contracts. Each player starts with a locomotive and a dream, and the goal is to transport goods, passengers, and special items across the island.

### Components

The Kickstarter edition comes with beautifully illustrated cards, wooden tokens, and a rulebook that won't make you feel like you're reading an IKEA assembly guide. The quality of the components is top-notch, which is a pleasant surprise given the game's relatively modest funding goal.

**Pro Tip:** Keep a separate box for the tokens. Nothing ruins a game night faster than a rogue wooden barrel under the couch.

## Gameplay: Choo-Choo Challenges

### Building Trains

Each turn, players can draw cards, play cards to build their trains, or complete delivery contracts. The cards come in four types: locomotives, carriages, goods, and passengers. Strategically combining these cards is crucial to creating the most efficient train.

**Funny Moment:** During one game, I attempted to build a train with four passenger carriages and no goods. My passengers ended up stranded at the station, much like me waiting for a late-night Uber.

### Completing Deliveries

Deliveries are the heart of Isle of Trains. Each contract requires specific goods or passengers to be transported to a destination card. Successfully completing deliveries earns players points and often triggers hilarious chain reactions.

For instance, delivering passengers to the beach might give you a bonus card that lets you deliver ice cream to the park. It's like a domino effect of delightful chaos.

### Interaction and Strategy

The game encourages interaction between players, both through competitive deliveries and the occasional sabotage—because what's a train game without a little mischief?

**Criticism Alert:** While the interactive elements add fun, they can sometimes lead to frustration, especially when your carefully planned delivery gets derailed by an opponent's sneaky move. But hey, it's all part of the game!

## Humor and Fun Factor

What sets Isle of Trains apart is its humor. The game doesn't take itself too seriously, and neither should you. From the pun-filled cards to the absurd scenarios, there's plenty of laughter to be had.

**Funny Moment:** In one game, I had to deliver a barrel of monkeys to the zoo. The card illustration showed monkeys causing havoc in the carriage, and the laughter that followed was legendary.

**Pro Tip:** Embrace the chaos. Don't get too attached to your plans—expect the unexpected and enjoy the ride.

## Comparison with Other Train Games

### [Ticket to Ride]({{ site.constants.wsib }}ticket-to-ride)

Ticket to Ride is often considered the gold standard of train games. It's all about collecting cards and claiming routes. Isle of Trains, on the other hand, adds layers of strategy with the delivery contracts and interactive gameplay.

### [Railroad Ink]({{ site.constants.wsib }}railroad-ink)

Railroad Ink is a dice-rolling game focused on creating the best network. Isle of Trains offers a more thematic and humorous experience, making it ideal for players who love storytelling in their games.

### [Russian Railroads]({{ site.constants.wsib }}russian-railroads)

Russian Railroads is a heavy euro game with deep strategy. Isle of Trains is lighter and more accessible, perfect for casual game nights with friends or family.

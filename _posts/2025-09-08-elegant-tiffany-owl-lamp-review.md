Today, we’re diving into the whimsical world of the **Elegant Tiffany Owl Lamp with Stained Glass Shade**. This 10-inch decor piece is sure to brighten up your home and make you the wise owl of interior design.

## Design and Aesthetic 🎨

The first thing that caught my eye about the Tiffany Owl Lamp is its intricate stained glass shade.

The owl itself is charming and adds a touch of whimsy to your decor. 

The lamp stands at 10 inches tall, making it a perfect size for a bedside table, desk, or bookshelf. It’s compact yet eye-catching, and its playful design will make you smile every time you see it.

The lamp uses a standard bulb, which emits a warm and inviting light. It’s bright enough to read by, but not so bright that it’s overwhelming. Perfect for creating a cozy atmosphere in any room.

## Introduction

Hello fellow dungeon dwellers! Ready to dive into the dark alleys of Dungeon Petz? Get ready to explore a whimsical world filled with quirky creatures, strategic play, and more hilarity than you can shake a goblin at! If you're a fan of board games that mix strategy with humor, you've come to the right place.

## The Basics

### What is Dungeon Petz?

Dungeon Petz is a competitive, strategy board game where players take on the role of pet shop owners in a fantastical world. Your task? To raise, care for, and sell the most extraordinary and bizarre pets you can find. But beware, these pets don't just sit quietly—they have needs, desires, and sometimes a penchant for chaos!

### Components

The game includes beautifully illustrated game boards, pet miniatures, cards, and tokens. You'll find everything from cages and food supplies to magical artifacts and poop tokens (yes, poop tokens). The artwork is charmingly grotesque and adds to the immersive experience of running a pet shop in a dungeon.

## The Gameplay

### Setting Up

Setting up Dungeon Petz can feel like prepping for a magical pet show. Lay out your player boards, organize the pet miniatures, and prepare for a mix of strategy and mayhem. The setup is detailed but manageable, especially with a few sacrificial offerings of your sanity.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players will bid on pet cages, acquire new pets, and manage the needs of their existing pets. Actions include feeding, entertaining, and cleaning up after your creatures. The bidding mechanism adds a competitive edge, while managing pet needs requires careful planning and a bit of luck.

### Pet Management

Pets in Dungeon Petz have specific needs—food, play, cleanliness, and sometimes a dark desire for mischief. Keeping your pets happy is key to winning, but they can be demanding. Expect moments where your meticulous plans are thwarted by a pet throwing a tantrum or pooping unexpectedly.

## The Story

### Campaign Mode

Dungeon Petz offers a thematic campaign mode where players progress through various scenarios, each adding new challenges and objectives. The storyline is filled with humor and fantasy, making each game session feel like an episode of a fantastical sitcom.

### Side Missions & Characters

The game includes numerous side missions and character-specific quests that add depth and replayability. Each pet owner has unique abilities and goals, encouraging different strategies and play styles. Just don't get too attached—pets can be sold off for profit, sometimes reluctantly.

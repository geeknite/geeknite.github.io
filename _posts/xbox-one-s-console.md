### Performance

Sure, the Xbox One S won't win any races against the Xbox Series X, but it's still chugging along like a champ. Perfect for playing older titles and some newer ones at lower settings. If you squint hard enough, you might confuse it with a high-end console. Just kidding, it's like comparing a sports car to a tricycle but hey, some of us love tricycles!

## Games: Oldies but Goldies

### Exclusive Titles

The Xbox One S has a library filled with classics that can still provide hours of entertainment.

- **Halo 5: Guardians**: The game where you can still feel like a space-age warrior.
- **Forza Horizon 3**: Speeding through Australia never gets old.
- **Gears of War 4**: Chainsawing your enemies is always therapeutic.

### Backward Compatibility

One of the biggest wins for the Xbox One S is its backward compatibility. You can play games from the Xbox 360 era, and even some original Xbox titles! It's like rummaging through your grandma's attic and finding your old Pokemon cards. Pure joy!

## Online Services: Xbox Live Gold and Game Pass

### Xbox Live Gold

Xbox Live Gold provides stable server connections, making online multiplayer experiences smooth, even if the free games might not be as exciting as you'd hope. But hey, if you love stability, this is your jam.

### Xbox Game Pass

Game Pass is the buffet of gaming. For a monthly fee, you get access to a massive library of games. It's like Netflix, but for gamers. If you love variety and have commitment issues, Game Pass will be your best friend.

## Price and Value: Cheap Thrills

### Current Pricing

The Xbox One S is now sold at a much lower price, ranging from $150 to $200. It's a bargain for those who want a console without breaking the bank. Plus, you can probably find it bundled with some games for extra value. It's the console equivalent of finding money in your old jeans.

## Design: Sleek and Understated

### Aesthetics

The Xbox One S has a minimalist design that's neither here nor there. It's like that friend who always dresses in neutral colors and never stands out at parties. But it's slim and fits nicely into any entertainment setup without taking up too much space.

## Conclusion

So, is the Xbox One S still worth it in 2025? If you're looking for a budget-friendly console to play some old favorites and enjoy backward compatibility, absolutely. But if you're chasing the latest and greatest, you might want to look at newer models. The Xbox One S is like your comfortable old sneakers—reliable, familiar, and still good for a casual run.

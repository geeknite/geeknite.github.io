If you're like me, you love mountain biking. You love the thrill of riding on rough terrain, the adrenaline of jumping over obstacles, the freedom of exploring new trails. But you also know that mountain biking can be hard on your hands. You need gloves that can protect your palms from blisters, your fingers from cuts and scrapes, and your knuckles from bruises. You also want gloves that fit well, feel comfortable, and look awesome.

That's why I love the **Sombrio Cartel Gloves**. They are hands down (pun intended) the best gloves I've ever tried for mountain biking. And I've tried a lot. In this blog post, I'll tell you why I think these gloves are so great, and why you should get them too.

## What are the Sombrio Cartel Gloves?

The Sombrio Cartel Gloves are a product of **Sombrio**, a clothing and gear mountain biking brand from Canada. Sombrio is not one of the big brands in the industry, but it has a loyal fan base of riders who appreciate its quality products and its cool alternative vibe. Sombrio offers all kinds of mountain biking equipment, from shorts to gloves and casual wear.

The Cartel Gloves are one of their flagship products. They are designed for all-mountain riding, meaning they can handle any kind of terrain and weather. They are made of durable synthetic leather and breathable mesh, with silicone grippers on the fingers and palm for better control. They also have a touch screen compatible thumb and index finger, so you can use your phone or GPS without taking them off.

But what makes these gloves stand out is their style. They come in various colors and patterns, from black to camo to floral. They have a sleek and modern look, with a logo patch on the back of the hand and a velcro closure on the wrist. They look like something a superhero would wear, or a secret agent. They make you feel badass.

## Why do I love the Sombrio Cartel Gloves?

I love the Sombrio Cartel Gloves for many reasons. Here are some of them:

- They protect my hands from injuries. I've had my share of crashes and falls on my bike, and these gloves have saved my hands from serious damage. They are thick enough to cushion the impact, but not so bulky that they restrict my movement. They also prevent blisters and chafing from long rides.
- They improve my grip and control. The silicone grippers on the fingers and palm give me a better hold on my handlebars and brakes. They also prevent my hands from slipping when they get sweaty or wet. I feel more confident and stable on my bike with these gloves on.
- They are comfortable and breathable. The mesh material on the back of the hand allows air to flow through, keeping my hands cool and dry. The synthetic leather is soft and flexible, conforming to my hand shape. The velcro closure is easy to adjust and secure, without being too tight or loose.
- They are touch screen compatible. This is a huge plus for me, as I like to use my phone or GPS while riding. I can check my route, take photos, or answer calls without taking off my gloves. This saves me time and hassle, and also keeps my hands warm in cold weather.
- They look awesome. I admit it, I'm vain. I like to look good on my bike, and these gloves help me do that. They match well with my other gear, and they add some flair to my outfit. They also make me stand out from other riders, who often wear boring or generic gloves. I get compliments on them all the time.

## How do they compare to other gloves?

I've tried many other gloves for mountain biking, but none of them compare to the Sombrio Cartel Gloves. Here are some examples:

- [Fox Ranger Gloves]({{ site.constants.wsib }}fox ranger gloves): These are popular gloves among mountain bikers, but I find them too thin and flimsy. They don't offer much protection or grip, and they wear out quickly.
- [Dakine Cross-X Gloves]({{ site.constants.wsib }}dakine cross gloves): These are decent gloves for downhill riding, but they are too heavy and hot for me. They also have a weird fit that makes them uncomfortable.
- [Giro DND Gloves]({{ site.constants.wsib }}giro dnd gloves): These are simple and minimalist gloves that work well for casual riding, but they lack features and style that I want in my gloves.
- [Troy Lee Designs Ace Gloves]({{ site.constants.wsib }}troy lee ace gloves): These are stylish and colorful gloves that look good, but they are too expensive and not very durable. They also run small and tight, which makes them hard to put on and off.

## Where can you get the Sombrio Cartel Gloves?

If you're interested in getting the Sombrio Cartel Gloves, you can find them online, check [{{ site.constants.wsibName }}, a offer finder site]({{ site.constants.wsib }}sombrio cartel gloves) or in some local bike shops, they may be difficult to find on some regions but they are worth and considering they are a not one of the massive brands they usually can be found on offer.

## Conclusion

The Sombrio Cartel Gloves are my favorite gloves for mountain biking. They protect my hands, improve my grip, feel comfortable, work with touch screens, and look awesome. They are the perfect gloves for all-mountain riding, and I highly recommend them to anyone who loves mountain biking.

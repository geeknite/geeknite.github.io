## What is Trekking The National Parks?

### The Premise

Trekking The National Parks is an educational and entertaining game that invites players to travel across the US's magnificent national parks. Players collect stones, take photos, and experience the wonders of nature—all from the comfort of their living room. It's like a cross-country road trip without the need for gas money or awkward family selfies.

### Components

The game includes a beautifully illustrated board featuring all 63 national parks, colorful player pieces, trek cards, stones of various colors, and a rulebook. The artwork is stunning and truly captures the essence of each park, making it feel like you're actually there—minus the mosquito bites.

**Fun Fact**: The game's creator was inspired to develop it after visiting all the featured parks. Now that's dedication!

## Gameplay

### Setup

Setting up the game is quick and easy. Players place their pieces on the starting points and distribute the trek cards. The objective is to visit as many parks as possible, collect stones, and take photos. Points are earned based on the parks visited, stones collected, and photos taken. The player with the most points at the end wins.

**Pro Tip**: Keep the rulebook handy. While the game is easy to learn, some of the finer details might leave you as puzzled as a hiker without a map.

### Turn Phases

Each turn consists of several phases:

1. **Movement**: Players move their pieces across the board, visiting different parks.
2. **Trekking**: Players collect stones and trek cards, which represent various activities and landmarks within the parks.
3. **Action**: Players can use their trek cards to perform actions such as taking photos or drawing additional cards.

### Strategy and Fun

The game combines strategy with a touch of luck. Players must decide the best routes to take, which parks to prioritize, and how to use their trek cards effectively. With each park visited and each photo taken, the excitement builds as players race to complete their objectives.

**Hilarious Mishap**: During one game, a player tried to visit Yosemite but ended up at Yellowstone. The resulting confusion and laughter were worth more than any point tally.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- **Educational Value**: Learn about the national parks while having fun.
- **Beautiful Artwork**: The illustrations are simply stunning and add to the immersive experience.
- **Strategic Depth**: Offers meaningful decisions that keep experienced gamers engaged.
- **Replayability**: Variable card draws and park visits ensure no two games are identical.

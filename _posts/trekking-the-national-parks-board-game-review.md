## Introduction

Hello, fellow adventurers! Ready to embark on a journey across America’s most stunning landscapes? With **Trekking The National Parks: The Board Game - Second Edition**, you can explore the beauty of the national parks right from your living room. So grab your hiking boots, some trail mix, and let’s dive into this epic board game that promises fun, strategy, and perhaps a squirrel or two.

## What is Trekking The National Parks?

Trekking The National Parks is a family-friendly board game designed by Underdog Games. This second edition brings updated artwork, refined rules, and new components to enhance your journey through the national parks. The game accommodates 2-6 players and takes about 30-60 minutes to play, making it perfect for both quick sessions and extended game nights.

### Components

The game includes a beautifully illustrated board depicting the national parks of the United States, player markers shaped like hikers, a deck of Trek Cards, stones representing the points you collect, and a variety of tokens. The artwork is top-notch, capturing the majesty of the parks with vibrant colors and detailed illustrations.

**Pro Tip:** Keep the component pieces away from your pets. Unless you want your tokens to go on a real-life adventure under the couch.

### Gameplay

In Trekking The National Parks, players set out to visit various national parks and collect stones, points, and park cards. Each turn involves movement, collecting cards, and strategic decision-making to maximize points. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

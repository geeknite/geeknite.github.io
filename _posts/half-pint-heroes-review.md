## What is Half Pint Heroes?

Half Pint Heroes is a trick-taking card game with a twist. Players must predict how many tricks they will win each round, but the unpredictable nature of the game means you'll always be on your toes. It's perfect for 2-7 players, making it an excellent choice for both small gatherings and larger parties.

### Game Components

The game comes with:

- **Cards**: A deck of beautifully illustrated cards, each depicting a different character or item.
- **Tokens**: Used to keep track of scores and bets.
- **Game Board**: A small board to organize cards and track rounds.

**Pro Tip**: Don't drink too much while playing. Your strategy might turn into a comedy show!

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up Half Pint Heroes is as easy as pie. Shuffle the deck, deal cards to each player, and place the game board in the center. Then, distribute tokens to keep track of bets and scores. You're ready to go!

### Turns and Actions

Each player starts by predicting how many tricks they will win that round. Cards are played in turns, and the highest card of the leading suit wins the trick. The real challenge (and hilarity) comes from trying to meet your predictions while thwarting your opponents' plans.

### Scoring

Points are awarded based on how accurately you predicted your wins. If you guessed correctly, you score big. If not, well, better luck next time!

## The Fun Factor

### The Characters

One of the standout features of Half Pint Heroes is its colorful cast of characters. Each card features a unique and often humorous illustration, from the grizzled pirate to the mischievous leprechaun. These characters add a layer of charm and personality to the game, making every round a visual treat.

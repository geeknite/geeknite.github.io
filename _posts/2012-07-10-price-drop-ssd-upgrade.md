**Want to upgrade your computer but can't afford a new one**? Or just simply don't want to have working computer getting dusty in a corner? You probably have already heard about SSD on high end laptops like [macbooks]({{ site.constants.wsib }}macbook), but you probably have also heard that they are pricey or at least until now.\
First let's introduce the concept of *SSD* and later talk about its prices.

### SSD?

*SSD* is an acronym for Solid State Drive, you may have some *USB* pen drive, you can imagine that *SSDs* are something like a bigger version. *SSDs* do not have moving parts, data is stored in microchips, in the other hand, a conventional hard drive uses a mechanical arm that moves and reads or writes the information in the disk. This difference is what makes ***SSD* much faster and more reliable**, *SSD* use *NAND*-based flash memory, a type of permanent memory that has a data storage integrity for over 200 years and more power efficient and also one of the best features is that ***SSD* consume relatively less power than traditional storage disks**, this makes them ideal for laptops.

Additionally *SSD* have the same format as hard drives so they can be replaced easily with an *SSD*, normally their size is 2.5", if you have a desktop computer will need a bracket to convert it to 3.5".
However, one of the downside is the short lifetime of the *SSD* drive in comparison to traditional *HDD*. One of the ways to increase the lifetime of your *SSD* drive is to disable unnecessary write access. There are many applications that will do this process easier, such as [SSD Fresh](http://www.abelssoft.net/ssdfresh.php){: rel="nofollow"}.

And one more warning, ***SSDs* don't make noise**, it will not give you a warning of something wrong, they just die. Then, you should always have complete image backups of your systems so you should be able to get back in no time, your important data should be replicated, and if you can not have all your data replicated you should select your sensitive data and system images.

### Prices of SSDs

After this small introduction it shouldn't be a surprise that an *SSD* is the best upgrade you can get for your computer and now is a great time to buy one, because the formerly-expensive drives have dropped dramatically in price over the past months this would be the perfect time to buy one. After last year's Thailand floods, prices got stuck for some time, but ***SSD* prices have continued dropping dramatically, many models being 65% cheaper than they were only a few months ago**, *SSDs* have never been more affordable and they can make breathe new life into your computer. If you've been waiting to do a step forward, now is a great time to make the change.

**My recommendation is to buy a relatively small *SSD* for your *OS* and programs** that depend much on disk reading, **and have a [traditional hard disk]({{ site.constants.wsib }}hard%20disk%20drive) for store data**, then you will not need much space, [128GB]({{ site.constants.wsib }}ssd%20128gb) will be enough, and your pocket will not hurt much.

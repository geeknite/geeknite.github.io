## What is Blank Slate?

Blank Slate is a word association party game where you try to predict what your friends and family are thinking. The game is simple: choose a word to complete a phrase, and try to match your answer with others to score points. Sounds easy, right? Think again! You'll be surprised how different everyone's thoughts can be.

## How to Play

Here's a quick rundown of the rules:

1. **Setup**: Each player gets a dry-erase board and marker. Shuffle the deck of cue cards.
2. **Draw a Cue Card**: The active player draws a cue card, which has a word with a blank. For example: "___ tree."
3. **Write Your Answer**: Everyone writes a word on their board to complete the phrase. The goal is to match with other players.
4. **Reveal**: All players reveal their answers simultaneously. Points are awarded based on how many people wrote the same word.
5. **Repeat**: The game continues until the cue cards run out or everyone is laughing too hard to continue.

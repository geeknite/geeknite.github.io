## Comparison with Other Helmets

How does the Blanco Helmet stack up against other popular helmets on the market? Let’s find out.

### Bell Super DH MIPS

The Bell Super DH MIPS is another great helmet, but it’s more geared towards downhill and enduro riding. It’s heavier and bulkier compared to the Blanco Helmet, but it has excellent protection and a detachable chin guard.

### Giro Switchblade

The Giro Switchblade is similar to the Bell Super DH in terms of protection, but it’s even heavier. It’s great for aggressive riding, but if you’re looking for a lightweight and stylish helmet, Blanco is the better choice.

### POC Tectal

The POC Tectal offers great protection and ventilation, but it falls short in terms of comfort compared to the Blanco Helmet. The padding on the Blanco is much softer and more adjustable.

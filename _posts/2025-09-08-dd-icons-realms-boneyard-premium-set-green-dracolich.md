- **Base and Stand**: Ensures your dracolich remains upright and imposing.
- **Collector's Box**: Fancy packaging to show off that you are serious about your miniatures.

## The Quality

### Design and Detail

The Green Dracolich is sculpted with intricate details, from its decaying scales to its haunting eyes. The artists behind this creation have truly outdone themselves. If the term 'beauty in death' ever applied to anything, it’s this miniature.

**Fun Fact**: The Green Dracolich’s eyes are designed to glow in the dark, ensuring it can spook your friends even when the lights are out.

### Durability

Made from high-quality resin, this miniature is built to withstand the rigors of battle. However, like any collectible, handle with care—those claws are sharp and ready to scratch more than just your enemies.

## Using the Green Dracolich in Your Campaign

### Story Ideas

Here are some thrilling ways to incorporate the Green Dracolich into your D&D campaign:

- **Ancient Curse**: The dracolich is the guardian of a cursed artifact that your party must retrieve.
- **Undead Army**: It commands legions of skeleton warriors, making for an epic battle scenario.
- **Broken Alliance**: Once a protector of a forest, the dracolich was corrupted and now seeks revenge on its former allies.

### Gameplay Mechanics

As you might expect, the Green Dracolich is no ordinary foe. Here are a few mechanics to consider:

- **Breath Weapon**: A poisonous breath that can decimate the healthiest of adventurers.
- **Fear Aura**: Its presence alone can instill fear, causing even the bravest to rethink their tactics.
- **Regeneration**: Being undead has its perks—this dragon doesn’t go down easily.

**Pro Tip**: Use the dracolich sparingly. Its sheer power can overwhelm your players, so be sure to balance the encounter to keep the game fun and challenging.

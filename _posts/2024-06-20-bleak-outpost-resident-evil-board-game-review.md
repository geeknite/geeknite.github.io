## Introduction

Welcome, zombie enthusiasts and survival strategists! Today, we're diving into the treacherous world of **Bleak Outpost: Resident Evil Board Game**. If you've ever wanted to experience the thrill and horror of surviving a zombie apocalypse right from your living room, then this game is your perfect match. Prepare yourself for a journey filled with desperate scrambles, cunning strategies, and the occasional laugh when your plans go hilariously wrong.

## The Basics

### What is Bleak Outpost?

Bleak Outpost is a cooperative strategy board game based on the popular Resident Evil video game series. Designed to capture the essence of the survival horror experience, this game allows players to work together to complete missions, battle zombies, and uncover the dark secrets of the outpost. One player takes on the role of the mission leader, while others control various survivors with unique abilities.

### Components

The game comes with a beautifully designed board, depicting various post-apocalyptic locations, and high-quality miniatures, representing both the survivors and the zombies. The detailed artwork and sturdy components ensure an immersive gaming experience. Additionally, the game includes various tokens, cards, and a rulebook that's surprisingly easy to understand-what a rarity in the board gaming world!

## Gameplay

### Setting Up

Setup is straightforward. The mission leader secretly plans their moves on a hidden board, while the survivors are positioned on the main board. The objective for the survivors is to complete their mission objectives without being overwhelmed by the zombie hordes, while the mission leader must work together with the survivors to ensure their success.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, the survivors move cautiously across the board, using various actions to avoid detection, such as moving quietly, creating distractions, or taking out zombies with silent kills. The mission leader, on the other hand, guides the survivors based on limited information, trying to predict the zombies' movements and set traps.

### Stealth and Strategy

The game shines in its strategic depth. As the survivors, you must carefully plan your moves, utilize cover, and think several steps ahead to outwit the zombies. For the mission leader, cooperation and deduction are key. You'll need to communicate effectively, share information, and anticipate the zombies' tactics to corner them successfully.

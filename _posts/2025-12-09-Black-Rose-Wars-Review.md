## The Basics of Black Rose Wars

Black Rose Wars is a competitive deck-building, area control game set in the magical academy of the Black Rose. Players take on the roles of powerful mages vying for the title of Grand Master by casting spells, summoning creatures, and sabotaging their opponents. The game is for 1-4 players and combines strategy, tactics, and a bit of luck.

### Components

- Highly detailed miniatures representing the mages and their summoned creatures.
- A modular game board that changes with each playthrough.
- A plethora of spell cards divided into different schools of magic.
- Various tokens and markers to track health, power, and other game elements.

**Pro Tip**: Keep your miniatures away from curious pets. They might end up as chew toys!

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up Black Rose Wars is like preparing for a magical duel. Lay out the modular game board, choose your mage, and prepare your spell deck. Each player starts with a set of basic spells and can acquire more powerful ones as the game progresses.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn consists of several phases:

1. **Planning Phase**: Players secretly choose their spells and plan their actions.
2. **Action Phase**: Players take turns casting spells, moving their mages, and summoning creatures.
3. **Event Phase**: Draw event cards that introduce new challenges and opportunities.
4. **End Phase**: Resolve effects, gain points, and prepare for the next round.

### Winning and Losing

The goal is to accumulate the most power by the end of the game. Points are earned by controlling areas, defeating enemies, and completing objectives. The mage with the most points becomes the new Grand Master of the Black Rose.

**Pro Tip**: Focus on your objectives, but don't forget to mess with your opponents. A well-timed sabotage can turn the tides in your favor.

## Introduction

Welcome, fellow survivors! Today, we're diving deep into the dark, zombie-infested world of **Zombicide** with a special focus on the **Edouard Guiton** guest box. If you're a fan of intense strategy, endless waves of the undead, and miniatures so detailed you might mistake them for your ex (hello, creepy!), then buckle up. This guide will ensure you and your team don't end up as a zombie buffet.

## Meet Edouard Guiton

Edouard Guiton, the genius artist behind many of Zombicide's most iconic characters, brings his unique style to this special guest box. The box includes new survivors and zombie miniatures, each one a work of art ready to paint and display (or, more practically, to use in your game).

### What's in the Box?

- **Survivors**: New characters with unique abilities and backgrounds.
- **Zombies**: Special zombie miniatures to add variety to your game.
- **Cards**: Equipment, skills, and events tailored to the new characters.
- **Dashboard**: A handy tool for tracking your survivor's progress.

## Survivors and Their Abilities

Each survivor in the Edouard Guiton box comes with unique abilities that can turn the tide of the game. Here's a rundown of the new characters and some tips on how to use them effectively.

### Survivor 1: The Tank

**Strengths**: High health, great in melee combat.
**Weaknesses**: Slow movement, limited ranged attack.
**Strategy**: Use the Tank to clear out hordes of zombies in close quarters. Pair them with a survivor who has healing abilities to keep them in the fight.

### Survivor 2: The Sniper

**Strengths**: Long-range attacks, high accuracy.
**Weaknesses**: Fragile, vulnerable in close combat.
**Strategy**: Keep the Sniper at a distance, covering chokepoints and picking off zombies before they get close. Use terrain to your advantage.

### Survivor 3: The Medic

**Strengths**: Healing abilities, support skills.
**Weaknesses**: Weak attack power, needs protection.
**Strategy**: Stick close to the Tank or other front-line fighters, keeping them healed and in fighting shape. The Medic is crucial for long missions.

## Zombie Tactics

The new zombies in the Edouard Guiton box aren't just pretty faces (or what's left of them). They bring new challenges and require fresh strategies.

### Special Zombie 1: The Sprinter

**Abilities**: Fast movement, can cover large distances quickly.
**Strategy**: Prioritize taking down Sprinters first, as they can close the gap and overwhelm survivors quickly. Use your Sniper to pick them off from a distance.

### Special Zombie 2: The Tank

**Abilities**: High health, resistant to damage.
**Strategy**: Use concentrated firepower to take these zombies down. Avoid engaging in melee unless you have a high-damage survivor.

## Advanced Strategies

Now that you know the basics, let's dive into some advanced strategies to keep you ahead of the undead hordes.

### Team Composition

- **Balanced Team**: A good mix of Tank, Sniper, and Medic ensures you're prepared for any situation.
- **Specialized Team**: Focus on one strategy (e.g., all melee fighters) for specific missions, but beware of your weaknesses.

### Resource Management

- **Ammo Conservation**: Don't waste ammo on weak zombies. Use melee attacks when possible.
- **Equipment Sharing**: Trade equipment between survivors to optimize your team's strengths.

### Map Control

- **Chokepoints**: Use narrow passages and doors to control zombie movement and create kill zones.
- **Search Locations**: Prioritize searching buildings for equipment early in the game.

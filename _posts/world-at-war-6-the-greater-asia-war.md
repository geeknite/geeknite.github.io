## The Basics

### What is World at War 6: The Greater Asia War?

World at War 6: The Greater Asia War is a grand strategy board game that simulates the conflicts in Asia during World War II.

## Gameplay

### Setting Up

Setup can be a bit daunting for newcomers. It involves placing various units on the board according to historical positions, shuffling decks, and preparing player aids. But fear not, with a bit of practice, you'll be ready to conquer Asia in no time.

Each turn is divided into phases: Movement, Combat, Supply, and Diplomacy. Players move their units, engage in battles, manage their resources, and attempt to sway neutral countries to their cause. The strategic depth is immense, and every decision can have far-reaching consequences.

### Combat System

Combat is resolved through a combination of dice rolls and modifiers based on unit types and terrain. It's a heart-pounding affair where even the best-laid plans can be thwarted by a single bad roll. Pro tip: always have a backup plan, and maybe a backup for your backup.

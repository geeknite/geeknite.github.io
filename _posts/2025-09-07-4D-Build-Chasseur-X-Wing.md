## Building the Chasseur X-Wing

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Prepare Your Workspace**: Clear a space, gather your tools, and lay out all the pieces. If your desk looks like the aftermath of a Death Star explosion, take a moment to tidy up.
2. **Read the Instructions**: Yes, I know, reading instructions is for droids. But trust me, it'll save you from a lot of frustration later on.
3. **Assemble the Frame**: Begin by constructing the frame of the X-Wing. This part requires precision and patience. Channel your inner Jedi.
4. **Add the Details**: Slowly and carefully add the detailed pieces to the frame. This is where the magic happens, and your X-Wing starts to take shape.
5. **Attach Movable Parts**: Install the movable parts, such as the wings and cockpit. Ensure they function correctly, or you'll end up with a starfighter that can't fly.
6. **Apply Decals**: Customize your X-Wing with the provided decals. Let your creativity flow – after all, even the Rebellion needs a touch of flair!

### Tips and Tricks

- **Use Tweezers**: Some of the pieces are tiny. Tweezers will be your best friend.
- **Take Breaks**: Building a 4D model can be intense. Take breaks to avoid exhaustion and possible dark side temptations.
- **Double-Check Movable Parts**: Ensure all movable parts are functioning properly before final assembly.

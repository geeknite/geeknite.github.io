## Introduction

Welcome, chummers, to the world of **Shadowrun Street Wyrd**, where magic meets cyberpunk in a blend so potent, it might just make your head spin. If you're a fan of urban fantasy, over-the-top character abilities, and dice rolls that determine your fate, then this game is right up your alley.

## What is Shadowrun Street Wyrd?

**Shadowrun Street Wyrd** is the latest expansion to the popular Shadowrun board game series. It brings new spells, gear, and characters to the table, adding layers of depth and hilarity to your gameplay. Prepare to dive into a world where Matrix hackers, street shamans, and corporate mercenaries clash in epic battles with dragons, spirits, and the occasional angry pizza delivery guy.

### Components

The game comes with:
- **Miniatures**: Wonderfully detailed miniatures of new characters, including the infamous Street Shaman who may or may not be moonlighting as a DJ.
- **Cards**: Spell cards, gear cards, and event cards that add excitement and unpredictability to every session.
- **Game Board**: Various locations from the Shadowrun universe, including the seedy underbelly of the Sprawl and the high-tech corporate towers.
- **Tokens and Markers**: Used to track your health, essence, and how many times you've accidentally summoned a sprite instead of a spirit.

**Pro Tip**: Keep your miniatures away from cats. Trust me, the last thing you need is an angry street shaman being cat-jacked.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up Shadowrun Street Wyrd is like preparing for a magical heist. Lay out the game board, distribute the cards and miniatures, and choose your characters. Grab some snacks and maybe a stress ball, because you're about to dive into chaos.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players draw cards and take actions based on their character's abilities. You can move, attack, cast spells, hack the Matrix, and more. Cooperation is key, so strategize with your teammates to make the most of your abilities.

### Combat

Combat in Shadowrun Street Wyrd is a blend of strategy and luck. Each spell and attack has unique mechanics that add challenges and twists to the game. Ever tried casting a fireball only to turn it into a fire kitten? Welcome to the world of Street Wyrd, where unpredictability is the name of the game.

**Funny Moment**: During one game, our Decker tried to hack a corporate mainframe and ended up summoning a digital dragon. The dragon then proceeded to challenge us to a game of virtual chess. We lost.

One of the best parts of Shadowrun Street Wyrd is the diverse array of characters and spells. From the Ork Bruiser to the Elf Mage, each character offers unique abilities and hilarious combos. The spell cards bring a whole new level of madness, making every game session a memorable experience.

**Funny Moment**: Our Troll Street Samurai accidentally cast a spell that turned his sword into a bouquet of flowers. He then proceeded to fight off a gang of cybernetic goons with said flowers. Yes, he won.

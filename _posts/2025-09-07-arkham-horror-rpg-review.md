## The Basics of Arkham Horror RPG Manual Básico

Arkham Horror RPG Manual Básico is a tabletop role-playing game that immerses players in the mysterious and terrifying world inspired by H.P. Lovecraft. With detailed rules, character options, and scenarios, it offers a comprehensive and thrilling experience.

### Components

The manual includes everything you need to start your descent into madness:
- **Rulebook**: A hefty tome that will make you question your life choices (and sanity).
- **Character Sheets**: Customizable for creating your own unique investigator.
- **Scenarios**: Pre-built adventures to challenge your wits and bravery.

**Fun Fact**: The rulebook is thick enough to fend off a small shoggoth attack. Just saying.

## Gameplay

### Setting Up

Before diving into the heart of Arkham, you'll need to gather your fellow investigators and prepare your character sheets. The setup involves choosing a scenario, assigning roles, and mentally preparing yourself for the horrors that await.

### Turn Phases

Each game turn consists of several phases:
1. **Investigation Phase**: Players explore locations and gather clues.
2. **Encounter Phase**: Meet horrors and potentially lose your sanity (or your lunch).
3. **Mythos Phase**: The GM (Game Master) unleashes cosmic horrors upon the investigators.

### Winning and Losing

To win, investigators must solve mysteries and thwart the plans of the Great Old Ones. But beware! Losing your sanity or succumbing to too many horrors can lead to tragic ends.

**Pro Tip**: Always keep some sanity-restoring items handy. You never know when the Necronomicon will try to make small talk.

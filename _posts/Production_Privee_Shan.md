## Introduction

Welcome to another epic bike review from Geeknite! Today, we pedal into the world of the **Production Privee Shan**, a mountain bike that promises to deliver thrills, spills, and some serious trail cred. Will this bike live up to its high expectations, or will it be just another wheeled disappointment? Strap in (or should I say, helmet on) and let's find out!

## First Impressions

The Production Privee Shan is a sight to behold. With its sleek lines, vibrant colors, and aggressive stance, it's the kind of bike that makes other bikes feel inadequate. Trust me, if bikes had feelings, they'd need therapy after seeing this beast.

## Frame and Design

### The Geometry

The Shan's frame is crafted from high-quality chromoly steel, giving it a unique blend of strength and flexibility. This isn't just any steel—it's the kind of steel that laughs in the face of aluminum and titanium. The geometry is tailored for aggressive trail riding, with a slack head angle and a low bottom bracket. Your ride will be stable and confidence-inspiring, whether you're bombing downhill or navigating technical sections.

### The Aesthetics

The Shan is available in a variety of colors, each more eye-catching than the last. The finish is top-notch, with attention to detail that would make a Swiss watchmaker jealous. And the decals—oh, the decals. Let's just say that if you don't get compliments on your bike, it’s because people are too busy being awestruck.

## Components

### Suspension

The Shan is equipped with a RockShox Pike fork, offering 150mm of plush travel. This fork is known for its smooth performance and reliability, making it perfect for tackling rough trails with ease. Paired with the frame's geometry, it ensures that your front end remains composed even when the trail gets rowdy.

### Drivetrain

This bike doesn't skimp on the drivetrain. Shimano's XT groupset provides crisp and precise shifting, allowing you to focus on the ride rather than worrying about missed gear changes. Whether you're climbing a steep hill or sprinting down a descent, the Shan's drivetrain will keep you moving smoothly.

### Brakes

Stopping power is crucial, and the Shan doesn't disappoint. It comes with Shimano XT hydraulic disc brakes, known for their reliable performance and modulation. You can confidently tackle descents knowing that your brakes will respond instantly and smoothly.

## Performance

### Climbing

The Shan is no slouch when it comes to climbing. Despite its aggressive geometry, it manages to balance stability with agility. You'll find yourself comfortably tackling technical climbs, and the bike's efficiency will have you reaching the summit without feeling like you've just cycled up Everest.

### Descending

Descending is where the Shan truly shines. The combination of the chromoly frame, RockShox suspension, and slack geometry make for an exhilarating ride. The bike feels planted and stable, allowing you to push your limits and enjoy the descent without worrying about losing control.

### Cornering

Cornering on the Shan is a dream. The bike's design allows for quick and precise turns, giving you the confidence to tackle tight switchbacks and fast corners. The responsive handling means you'll be carving through trails like a pro.

## Funny Moments and Quirks

No bike review is complete without a few laughs. The Shan has its quirks, and they add to its charm. The chromoly frame might make you feel invincible, but remember—you're still human. I once found myself trying to impress a squirrel with my cornering skills. Let's just say, the squirrel was not impressed, and my ego took a hit.

And then there's the time I tried to show off the Shan’s climbing prowess to a group of hikers. Halfway up the hill, I realized I was in the wrong gear and ended up doing the walk of shame. But hey, it's all part of the fun!

## Comparison with Other Bikes

The Production Privee Shan is a unique beast, but how does it compare to other mountain bikes in its class? Here’s a quick rundown:

### [YT Jeffsy]({%- post_url 2016-05-24-yt-jeffsy-review-pros-y-contras-deberia-comprarla -%})

The Jeffsy is another great trail bike, known for its versatility and value. While it offers similar performance, the Shan's chromoly frame adds a touch of uniqueness. If you're looking for something different, the Shan might be your pick.

### [Canyon Spectral]({%- post_url 2018-07-23-canyon-breakaway-sale-2018 -%})

The Canyon Spectral excels in providing a balanced ride, with a focus on practicality and affordability. The Shan, on the other hand, is all about making a statement. If you want a bike that'll turn heads, the Shan is the way to go.

## Conclusion

The Production Privee Shan is a remarkable mountain bike that offers a blend of performance, style, and uniqueness. Whether you're an experienced rider looking for a reliable companion or a newbie wanting to make a splash, the Shan has something for everyone. Just be prepared for the inevitable bike envy from your riding buddies.

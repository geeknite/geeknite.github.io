## Introduction

Hello, fellow board game lovers! Today, we are diving into the mystical and divine world of **Dice Forge**. If you have a penchant for rolling dice and crafting your destiny, this game promises an epic combination of luck and strategy. Prepare to channel your inner deity as you forge powerful dice and compete for glory!

## What is Dice Forge?

Dice Forge is a strategic dice-crafting game where players take on the roles of heroes chosen by the gods to compete in a divine tournament. Players will earn resources, upgrade their dice, and complete heroic feats to gain glory points. The player with the most glory at the end of the game ascends to godhood!

### The Basics

In Dice Forge, each player starts with two customizable dice and a player board. The goal is to earn the most glory points by upgrading your dice, collecting resources, and completing heroic feats. The game combines elements of luck and strategy, making every roll of the dice an exciting experience.

### Components

The game comes with:
- **Customizable Dice**: High-quality dice with removable faces that can be upgraded throughout the game.
- **Player Boards**: Each player has a board to track their resources and progress.
- **Heroic Feat Cards**: These cards represent various challenges and rewards that players can strive for.
- **Tokens and Markers**: Used to track resources, glory points, and other game elements.

**Pro Tip**: Keep the dice away from your pets. You don’t want Fido swallowing your divine powers!

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up Dice Forge is as easy as pie (or should I say, as easy as forging a divine artifact?). Lay out the game board, distribute player boards, dice, and initial resources, and you're ready to roll!

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players roll their dice to gain resources. These resources can be used to upgrade dice or complete heroic feats. The key to victory is finding the right balance between upgrading your dice and pursuing heroic feats.

### Dice Crafting

Dice crafting is the heart of Dice Forge. Players can spend resources to buy new faces for their dice, increasing their chances of rolling higher-value resources or glory points. Customizing your dice to suit your strategy is both fun and crucial to winning the game.

## The Divine Competition

### Heroic Feats

Heroic feats are special cards that offer powerful rewards and glory points. Completing these feats requires specific resources and strategic planning. Some feats provide ongoing benefits, while others offer instant rewards.

**Funny Moment**: During one game, a player spent all their resources on a heroic feat only to realize they miscalculated and couldn't complete it. The resulting facepalm was legendary.

### Replayability

With multiple strategies and paths to victory, Dice Forge offers tremendous replayability. Each game can play out differently depending on player choices and dice rolls, ensuring you'll want to come back for more divine challenges.

**Expansion Alert**: Keep an eye out for expansions that introduce new dice faces, heroic feats, and game mechanics. Your divine tournament is about to get even more exciting.

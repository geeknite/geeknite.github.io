If you're wondering whether these sleeves are worth your hard-earned cash or if they're just another gimmick, stick around. Spoiler alert: hilarity ensues.

## **First Impressions**

When I first saw the Fundas Mayday Premium Custom Police sleeves, I thought, "Wow, these sleeves look like they mean business!" With a name like "Custom Police," you'd expect them to come with a badge and a siren. Unfortunately, they don't, but they sure do protect your cards like a SWAT team on a mission.

The packaging is sleek, with a design that screams "I take my board games seriously." If sleeves could wear aviator sunglasses, these would. The sleeves themselves are crystal clear, allowing your cards to shine without any unwanted glare or fingerprints.

## **Quality and Durability**

These sleeves are made from high-quality polypropylene, which is a fancy way of saying they're tough as nails. I've put them through the wringer—shuffling, bending, and even dropping my cards (whoops!)—and they held up like champions.

## Gameplay: Love in Action

Taza is all about expressing your passion for board games through action and strategy. Players must collect their favorite games, complete fun objectives, and avoid pitfalls like “The Table Flip” and “Lost Pieces.” Each turn is an ode to our beloved pastime.

### Turn Phases: The Rhythm of Romance

1. **Collection Phase**: Players gather board games from various genres. The more obscure, the better!

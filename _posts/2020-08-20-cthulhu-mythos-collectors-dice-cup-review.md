Lovecraft's eldritch horrors and enjoy the thrill of rolling dice, then this collector's item is a must-have. Prepare yourself for a journey into the unknown, where sanity is optional.

## What is the Cthulhu Mythos Collector's Dice Cup?

The Cthulhu Mythos Collector's Dice Cup is a beautifully crafted dice cup adorned with intricate designs inspired by the Cthulhu Mythos. It comes with a set of custom dice that feature symbols and imagery from Lovecraft's universe. Whether you're summoning ancient horrors or simply playing a game of chance, this dice cup adds a touch of cosmic dread to your gaming experience.

### Components

The dice cup includes:

- **Dice Cup**: A leather-like cup with embossed Cthulhu designs. It's sturdy and feels like it could withstand a trip to R'lyeh.
- **Custom Dice**: Six-sided dice with unique symbols, including the Elder Sign, the Sigil of the Gateway, and the Mark of Cthulhu.
- **Storage Pouch**: A velvet pouch to keep your dice safe from prying eyes (and tentacles).

**Pro Tip**: Keep the dice cup away from your cat. Tentacles and paws do not mix well.

## How to Use It

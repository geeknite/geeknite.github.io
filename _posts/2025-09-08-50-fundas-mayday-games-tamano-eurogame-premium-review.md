## Pros of Mayday Games Eurogame Premium Sleeves

### Durable and Protective

### Perfect Fit for Eurogames

The 59x92mm size is ideal for Eurogame cards, making them an excellent choice for games like **Ticket to Ride**, **Power Grid**, and **Terraforming Mars**. Say goodbye to awkwardly sized sleeves that turn your cards into misfits.

### Transparent and Clear

The transparency of these sleeves allows the beautiful artwork of your cards to shine through, preserving the aesthetic appeal of your games. Who wants to hide those stunning designs behind cloudy plastic?

### Affordable Investment

Compared to other premium brands, Mayday Games offers a cost-effective solution. You won't have to sell your kidney to afford quality sleeves for your entire collection.

## Cons of Mayday Games Eurogame Premium Sleeves

While the 90-micron thickness provides excellent protection, it also means your deck will be significantly bulkier. Be prepared for some difficulty fitting sleeved cards back into the original game box or insert.

### Shuffling Challenges

Shuffling sleeved cards can be a bit tricky, especially if you're used to the tactile feel of unsleeved cards. Your slick new sleeves might slip and slide, turning your shuffling into a comedy routine.

### Storage Struggles

If you're a sleeve addict, storing your sleeved games can become a logistical nightmare. Prepare for some creative storage solutions or invest in larger game boxes.

## To Sleeve or Not to Sleeve: The Verdict

So, should you invest in the 50 Fundas Mayday Games Tamaño Eurogame Premium sleeves? It ultimately comes down to your priorities. If you value the longevity and protection of your game cards, these sleeves are an excellent choice.

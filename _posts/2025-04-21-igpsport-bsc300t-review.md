Do you want a device that is easy to use, reliable, and compatible with your favorite apps like Strava and Garmin Connect? If so, you might be interested in the new iGPSPORT BSC300T, a wireless bike computer that offers a lot of features for a reasonable price.

## What is the iGPSPORT BSC300T?

The iGPSPORT BSC300T is a wireless bike computer that can connect to various sensors via Bluetooth or ANT+. It can measure your speed, cadence, heart rate, power, altitude, temperature, and more. It has a 2.4-inch color screen that is easy to read in any light condition. It has a built-in GPS that can track your route and distance. It has a decent battery life of up to 20 hours. It has a waterproof rating of IPX7, which means it can withstand rain and splashes.

## How does the iGPSPORT BSC300T compare to other bike computers?

There are many bike computers on the market, but I will focus on three of the most popular ones: the iGPSPORT 630, the Garmin Edge 530, and the Garmin Edge 540. These are all wireless bike computers that can measure similar data and connect to various sensors. They also have color screens, GPS, long battery life, waterproof rating, smartphone sync, and navigation features. However, they also have some differences that might make you prefer one over another.

### The iGPSPORT 630

The iGPSPORT 630 is another wireless bike computer from iGPSPORT that costs around $199.99 [check for offers at Foxxs]({{ site.constants.wsib }}igpsport igs630). It's the big brother of the BCS300T, it has a larger screen than the BSC300T (3 inches) and more data fields (up to 15). It also has more navigation features, such as turn-by-turn directions, voice prompts, and offline maps【4:1†source】【4:2†source】. It has a slightly shorter battery life than the BSC300T (20 hours) and a lower waterproof rating (IPX6)【4:1†source】.

The iGPSPORT 630 is a good choice for cyclists who want a bigger screen and more navigation options. However, it is also more expensive and less durable than the BSC300T【4:1†source】.

### The Garmin Edge 530

The Garmin Edge 530 is a wireless bike computer from Garmin that costs around $299.99 [check for offers at Foxxs]({{ site.constants.wsib }}garmin edge 530). It has a similar screen size as the BSC300T (2.6 inches) but more data fields (up to 20). It also has more advanced features, such as performance metrics, training plans, safety alerts, incident detection, group tracking, ClimbPro, MTB dynamics, Trailforks integration, and more. It has a longer battery life than the BSC300T (up to 40 hours) and a higher waterproof rating (IPX7)【4:14†source】【4:2†source】.

The Garmin Edge 530 is a great choice for cyclists who want the most comprehensive and sophisticated bike computer. However, it is also much more expensive and complex than the BSC300T【4:0†source】.

### The Garmin Edge 540

The Garmin Edge 540 is a wireless bike computer from Garmin that costs around $399.99 [check for offers at Foxxs]({{ site.constants.wsib }}garmin edge 540). It has a larger screen than the BSC300T (3.5 inches) and more data fields (up to 24). It also has all the features of the Edge 530, plus a touchscreen, a barometric altimeter, a gyroscope, a magnetometer, and a light sensor. It has a similar battery life as the BSC300T (up to 24 hours) and a higher waterproof rating (IPX7)【4:0†source】【4:2†source】.

The Garmin Edge 540 is the ultimate choice for cyclists who want the best of the best bike computer. However, it is also the most expensive and power-hungry than the BSC300T【4:0†source】【4:2†source】.

## Which bike computer should you buy?

As you can see, there are many factors to consider when choosing a bike computer. It depends on your personal preferences, needs, and budget. However, if you ask me, I would recommend the iGPSPORT BSC300T for most cyclists who want a reliable, easy-to-use, and affordable bike computer that can measure all the essential data and sync with your smartphone and online platforms【4:0†source】.

The iGPSPORT BSC300T has everything you need to enjoy your rides and improve your performance. It is compatible with various sensors and apps, has a clear color screen, has a long battery life, and has a reasonable price. It might not have all the bells and whistles of some of the other bike computers, but it does its job well and does not disappoint【4:4†source】.

## What is the iGPSPORT BSC300T?

The iGPSPORT BSC300T is a wireless bike computer that can connect to various sensors via Bluetooth or ANT+. It can measure your speed, cadence, heart rate, power, altitude, temperature, and more. It has a 2.4-inch color screen that is easy to read in any light condition, though I must admit it can be a bit challenging to see in extremely bright sunshine. It has a built-in GPS that can track your route and distance. It has a decent battery life of up to 20 hours. It has a waterproof rating of IPX7, which means it can withstand rain and splashes.

The iGPSPORT BSC300T can also sync with your smartphone via the iGPSPORT app. You can customize your data fields, upload your rides to online platforms like Strava and Garmin Connect, and receive notifications for calls, messages, and social media. You can also download maps and routes from the app and follow them on the device. One thing I particularly love is how well it pairs with Garmin accessories - I've successfully connected my Garmin Varia radar, speed sensor, and cadence sensor without any issues.

The iGPSPORT BSC300T comes with a mount that can be attached to your handlebar or stem. It also comes with a speed sensor and a cadence sensor that can be easily installed on your bike. You can pair it with other sensors that support Bluetooth or ANT+, such as heart rate monitors, power meters, or smart trainers. The setup process is surprisingly simple, especially when connecting sensors like heart rate monitors and cadence sensors.

The iGPSPORT BSC300T costs around $150, which is much cheaper than some of the other bike computers with similar features. At this price point, it offers truly remarkable value - you get amazing software and functionality that would cost significantly more with other brands. It is also available in black or white colors.

## Real-World Performance: My Extended Experience

![BSC300T Display Features](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61w86GKGkKL._AC_SX425_.jpg){: style="float: right; max-width: 280px;" alt="BSC300T bike computer showing GPS display and metrics"}

After using the BSC300T for several months, I can share some honest insights about its performance. The touchscreen interface is fantastic and makes navigation much more intuitive than button-only devices. The GPS mapping is very good overall, and I've been particularly impressed with how well it works with radar tail lamps - a feature that's become essential for my safety during rides.

However, I must be transparent about some limitations I've encountered. The navigation feature, while generally reliable, has one significant issue with out-and-back routes on the same road. The unit can get confused during these scenarios, sometimes turning off the green marked road display, making it appear as though you're off course when you're actually on the correct path. This typically resolves itself after 1-2 miles, but it can be concerning during longer rides. For routes without out-and-back sections, the navigation works perfectly fine.

Another minor accuracy concern I've noticed is a slight discrepancy compared to other devices. In my testing, the BSC300T tends to read about half a mile per hour slower and a few tenths per mile distance off compared to premium competitors. While this difference accumulates over longer rides (25-30 miles), it's worth considering whether this level of precision matters for your specific cycling goals.

The display, while generally excellent, could benefit from some improvements. The running average display in the top left corner is quite small and could be more prominent. Additionally, some users might find the speed metric appears twice on the main display, which seems redundant.

Despite these minor issues, the BSC300T excels in its core functions. It pairs flawlessly with Di2 groupsets and maintains excellent connectivity with various sensors. The battery life consistently exceeds single ride durations, and the device boots up quickly for immediate use.

## How does the iGPSPORT BSC300T compare to other bike computers?

There are many bike computers on the market, but I will focus on three of the most popular ones: the iGPSPORT 630, the Garmin Edge 530, and the Garmin Edge 540. These are all wireless bike computers that can measure similar data and connect to various sensors. They also have color screens, GPS, long battery life, waterproof rating, smartphone sync, and navigation features. However, they also have some differences that might make you prefer one over another.

## Which bike computer should you buy?

As you can see, there are many factors to consider when choosing a bike computer. It depends on your personal preferences, needs, and budget. However, if you ask me, I would recommend the iGPSPORT BSC300T for most cyclists who want a reliable, easy-to-use, and affordable bike computer that can measure all the essential data and sync with your smartphone and online platforms.

The iGPSPORT BSC300T has everything you need to enjoy your rides and improve your performance. It is compatible with various sensors and apps, has a clear color screen, has a long battery life, and has a reasonable price. While it might not have all the bells and whistles of some premium bike computers, it does its job well and rarely disappoints. For many cyclists, this device eliminates the need to spend significantly more on premium brands - it offers excellent bang for your buck.

The setup process might require some patience and experimentation, as the included instructions could be more comprehensive. However, once you've figured everything out, it becomes a really nice device that provides all the essential cycling data you need. The touchscreen interface is particularly appreciated coming from button-only devices.

For those considering whether to upgrade from other bike computers or looking to remove their smartphone from their bike setup (especially for Varia radar functionality), the BSC300T provides an excellent solution. It successfully consolidates multiple functions into one reliable device.

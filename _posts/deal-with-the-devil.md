### Overview

**Deal with the Devil** is a board game that seamlessly blends strategy, negotiation, and a sprinkle of dark humor.

But beware – making deals with the devil can come with unexpected consequences.

### Components

The game boasts high-quality components, including beautifully illustrated cards, detailed miniatures, and a stunning game board that will make you feel like you’ve stepped into a dark fairy tale.

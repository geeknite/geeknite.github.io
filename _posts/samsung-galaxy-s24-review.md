**Hello Geeknite readers!** Today, we're diving into the highly anticipated Samsung Galaxy S24. It's 2026, and Samsung has unveiled this beast of a phone that's got everyone talking. Does it live up to the hype, or is it just another flashy gadget? Let's find out!

## **Design and Build Quality**

The Samsung Galaxy S24 is a stunner at first glance. With its sleek metal body and glass back, it feels premium in hand. Available in three colors—Phantom Black, Phantom Silver, and Phantom Violet—there's a shade for everyone. The build quality holds up well, and it could probably survive a few accidental drops (not that we're recommending you try it).

## **Display**

The Galaxy S24 sports a 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED display with a resolution of 3200x1440 pixels. The colors are vibrant, and the blacks are as deep as a geek's love for Star Wars. With a 120Hz refresh rate, scrolling through memes has never been smoother. HDR10+ support ensures that your Netflix marathons are visually stunning.

## **Performance**

Under the hood, the Galaxy S24 is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor, coupled with up to 12GB of RAM. Multitasking is a breeze, and you can run multiple apps without feeling like you're operating a potato. Gaming performance is stellar, and you can run the latest AAA titles on max settings without a hitch.

## **Camera**

Samsung has equipped the Galaxy S24 with a quad-camera setup: a 108MP main sensor, a 12MP ultra-wide lens, a 10MP telephoto shooter, and a 5MP macro lens. It's no DSLR, but it takes solid photos in various lighting conditions. The night mode works well enough to capture those late-night pizza runs without too much grain. Selfies are handled by a 40MP front camera that does a decent job of making you look Instagram-ready.

## **Battery Life**

One of the standout features of the Galaxy S24 is its battery life. The 5000mAh battery easily lasts a full day of heavy use. Plus, with 65W fast charging and 30W wireless charging, you'll be back to scrolling through cat videos in no time.

## **Software**

The Galaxy S24 runs One UI 5.0 based on Android 13. It's packed with features, though it can feel a bit bloated at times. If you can overlook the occasional spammy notification, it's a smooth experience overall.

## **Price and Availability**

Priced at around $1200, the Galaxy S24 offers excellent value for money for a flagship device. It's available globally, and you can snag it on platforms like [Amazon and eBay]({{ site.constants.wsib }}samsung-galaxy-s24).

## **Comparison with Other Flagships**

While the Galaxy S24 impresses with its display and camera, the iPhone 15 Pro boasts better integration with other Apple devices and a slightly more intuitive UI. If you're already in the Apple ecosystem, the iPhone 15 Pro might be more appealing.

### [Samsung Galaxy S24 vs Google Pixel 7]({% post_url 2026-01-30-samsung-galaxy-s24-vs-google-pixel-7 %})

The Google Pixel 7 offers a purer Android experience and better software updates. However, the Galaxy S24 edges out in terms of hardware and overall performance.

## **Conclusion**

The Samsung Galaxy S24 is a solid flagship smartphone that delivers on most fronts. It has a premium design, vibrant display, reliable performance, and excellent battery life. While the software can feel a bit overwhelming and the camera won't win any awards, it's hard to beat the value it offers at this price point.

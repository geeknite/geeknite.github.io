**Hello Geeknite readers!** Today, we're tackling the latest contender in the flagship smartphone arena, the Samsung Galaxy S24. It's 2026, and Samsung is busy launching devices faster than a geek can say "upgrade." So, is the Galaxy S24 the phone you need, or will it leave you regretting your life choices? Let's find out!

## **Design and Build Quality**

The Samsung Galaxy S24 is a stunner at first glance. With its sleek metal body and glass back, it feels premium in hand. Available in three colors—Midnight Black, Aurora Blue, and Stardust Silver—there's a shade for everyone. The build quality holds up well, and it could probably survive a few accidental drops (not that we're recommending you try it).

## **Display**

The Galaxy S24 sports a 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED display with a resolution of 3200x1440 pixels. The colors are vibrant, and the blacks are as deep as a geek's love for Star Wars. With a 120Hz refresh rate, scrolling through memes has never been smoother.【4:0†source】

## **Performance**

Under the hood, the Galaxy S24 is powered by the Exynos 9950 processor, coupled with up to 12GB of RAM. Multitasking is a breeze, and you can run multiple apps without feeling like you're operating a potato. Gaming performance is top-notch, and AAA titles run like butter on max settings.

## **Camera**

Samsung has equipped the Galaxy S24 with a quad-camera setup: a 108MP main sensor, a 12MP ultra-wide lens, a 10MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom, and a 5MP macro shooter. It's no DSLR, but it takes stunning photos. The night mode works well enough to capture those late-night pizza runs without too much grain. Selfies are handled by a 40MP front camera that does a fantastic job of making you look Instagram-ready.

## **Battery Life**

One of the standout features of the Galaxy S24 is its battery life. The 5000mAh battery easily lasts a full day of heavy use. Plus, with 45W fast charging, you'll be back to scrolling through cat videos in no time.

## **Software**

The Galaxy S24 runs One UI 6 based on Android 14. It's packed with features, though it can feel a bit bloated at times. If you can overlook the occasional spammy notification, it's a smooth experience overall.

## **Price and Availability**

Priced at around $1200, the Galaxy S24 offers excellent value for a flagship device. It's available globally, and you can snag it on platforms like [Amazon and eBay]({{ site.constants.wsib }}samsung-galaxy-s24).

## **Criticism**

While the Galaxy S24 is impressive, it's not without its flaws. Some users reported a slight overheating issue during intensive gaming sessions. Additionally, the phone might be too large for those who prefer a more compact device. Also, the Exynos version tends to perform slightly worse than its Snapdragon counterpart in certain benchmarks.

## **Conclusion**

The Samsung Galaxy S24 is a solid flagship smartphone that delivers on most fronts. It has a premium design, vibrant display, reliable performance, and excellent battery life. While it has minor flaws, it's hard to beat the value it offers at this price point.

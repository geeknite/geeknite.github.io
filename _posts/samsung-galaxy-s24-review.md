## Introduction

Hello Geeknite readers! Today, we're diving into the latest marvel from Samsung, the Galaxy S24. It's 2026, and Samsung has yet again pushed the boundaries of smartphone technology. But does the Galaxy S24 live up to the hype, or is it just another shiny gadget meant to drain our wallets? Let's find out!

## Design and Build Quality

The Galaxy S24 is a sleek and stunning device. With its glass and metal body, it feels premium in hand. Available in three colors—Cosmic Black, Stellar Silver, and Nova Green—there's a shade for every personality. The build quality is top-notch, and it could probably survive a few accidental drops (not that we're recommending you try it). It's also IP68 certified, meaning it's dust and water-resistant. So if you accidentally drop it in the toilet, you'll be fine. Probably.

## Display

The S24 boasts a 6.9-inch Super AMOLED display with a resolution of 3200x1440 pixels. The colors are vibrant, and the blacks are as deep as a geek's love for sci-fi. With a 120Hz refresh rate, scrolling through memes has never been smoother. Samsung has also included HDR10+ support, making it perfect for binge-watching your favorite shows. It's like having a mini IMAX theater in your pocket.

## Performance

Under the hood, the Galaxy S24 is powered by the Exynos 9999 processor, coupled with up to 16GB of RAM. Multitasking is a breeze, and you can run multiple apps without feeling like you're operating a potato. Gaming performance is top-notch, and it handles the latest AAA titles with ease. Whether you're slaying dragons or just slaying boredom, the S24 has got you covered.

## Camera

Samsung has equipped the S24 with a quad-camera setup: a 108MP main sensor, a 12MP ultra-wide lens, a 10MP telephoto lens, and a 5MP macro shooter. It's no DSLR, but it takes stunning photos. The night mode works well enough to capture those late-night pizza runs without too much grain. Selfies are handled by a 40MP front camera that does a fantastic job of making you look Instagram-ready. Your friends will wonder if you hired a professional photographer.

## Battery Life

One of the standout features of the Galaxy S24 is its battery life. The 6000mAh battery easily lasts a full day of heavy use. Plus, with 65W fast charging, you'll be back to scrolling through memes in no time. Samsung has also included wireless charging and reverse wireless charging, so you can charge your friend's phone and call them a freeloader at the same time.

## Software

The S24 runs One UI 5.0 based on Android 14. It's packed with features, though it can feel a bit bloated at times. If you can overlook the occasional spammy notification, it's a smooth experience overall. Samsung has also promised four years of software updates, so your phone won't become obsolete after a year. Take that, planned obsolescence!

## Price and Availability

Priced at around $1200, the Galaxy S24 is definitely a premium device. It's available globally, and you can snag it on platforms like [eBay and Amazon]({{ site.constants.wsib }}samsung-galaxy-s24). If you're looking for a top-of-the-line smartphone and have some extra cash lying around, the S24 might just be the phone for you.

## Conclusion

The Samsung Galaxy S24 is a solid flagship smartphone that delivers on most fronts. It has a premium design, vibrant display, reliable performance, and excellent battery life. While the software can be a bit overwhelming and the camera won't win any awards, it's hard to beat the value it offers at this price point.

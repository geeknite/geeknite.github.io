## Design and Build Quality

### Sleek and Sturdy

The POCO Pad 12 comes with a sleek aluminum body that feels premium in hand. The build quality is impressive for a device in this price range, making it perfect for those accidental drops when you're too engrossed in binge-watching Netflix.

Under the hood, the POCO Pad 12 is powered by the MediaTek Helio G95 processor paired with 4GB of RAM. This combo ensures smooth multitasking and decent gaming performance. No, it won't run the latest AAA titles at max settings, but it can handle your favorite mobile games without breaking a sweat.

### Storage

With 64GB of internal storage, you have plenty of space for apps, photos, and your collection of funny dog videos. And if thatâ€™s not enough, it supports expandable storage up to 256GB. So go ahead, download that entire season of "Stranger Things."

## Camera

### Picture-Perfect?

The POCO Pad 12 features an 8MP rear camera and a 5MP front camera. It's not going to replace your DSLR, but itâ€™s more than capable of handling video calls and casual photography. Plus, the front camera will make sure you look good during those unexpected Zoom meetings.

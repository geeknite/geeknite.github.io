## The Concept

TRIO Country isn't just a band; it's an experience. Imagine if The Three Stooges decided to swap slapstick comedy for guitars and banjos. That's pretty much what you get with TRIO Country. The band consists of three zany characters: Hank, Bubba, and Cletus, each bringing their own brand of humor to the stage. Together, they create a musical rollercoaster that's equal parts funny and fantastic.

### Meet the Members

- **Hank**: The ringleader, known for his witty lyrics and infectious energy. He can strum a guitar like nobody's business.
- **Bubba**: The lovable goofball, always ready with a joke or a prank. His harmonica skills are second to none.
- **Cletus**: The silent genius, who lets his banjo do the talking. When he does speak, it's usually something hilariously profound.

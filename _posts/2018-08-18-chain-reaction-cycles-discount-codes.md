[Chain Reaction Cycles](https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=329899&mid=10467&awinaffid=364849&linkid=2100772&clickref=){: rel="nofollow"} is one of our favorite MTB online stores, it offers good prices and a great selection of items, from MTB to road, even if we don't usually go on road they have good equipment that can be used for offroad. Also they offer free shipping on reaching a certain amount, variable depending on the country, for example 49€ buying from Spain.

Since they merged with Wiggle, another giant in the biking online shopping, they are changing some of their policies, especially with discounts and promo codes.

Usually they offer discounts for their clearance products, usually already on sale, but you have to reach a certain amount to get the discount which is pretty complicated. Their offers don't last long so having to reach a certain amount can be a tedious work.

It seems that in the last weeks they are sending other discounts to key users, these discounts are not tied to clearance items so it is way easier to use it.

Here you can see the current discount codes available, these codes should work for all regions but the quantities may change depending on exchange rates:

These are not percentage based discounts which I prefer, because you get a discount proportional to what you spend, for example a bike, but for buying components or equipment are good discounts so use them.

Good shopping!

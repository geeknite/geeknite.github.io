It’s like James Bond, but with more rationed food and fewer fancy gadgets.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players will perform actions such as moving, attacking, and using equipment. The goal is to complete missions and objectives without alerting the enemy. It’s a bit like trying to sneak a snack from the fridge at midnight without waking your parents.

## **The History of The White Castle**

The White Castle isn't just a fast-food joint; it's a culinary institution. Founded in 1921 in Wichita, Kansas, it has grown to become a beloved American brand. With its signature sliders and unique square patty shape, White Castle revolutionized the fast-food industry.

### **Early Beginnings**

In the early 20th century, burgers were viewed with suspicion, thought to be unsanitary and unhealthy. Enter Billy Ingram and Walter Anderson, who sought to change the public perception by creating a clean, affordable, and delicious burger experience. The iconic white buildings, complete with gleaming stainless steel interiors, were designed to evoke cleanliness and purity.

### **A Legacy of Innovation**

As White Castle expanded, they introduced innovations like the industrialized food production system and the concept of fast food as we know it. Their commitment to quality and consistency has remained unchanged, and many of their original locations still stand as testament to their enduring legacy.

## Introduction

Welcome, chummers! Today we're diving headfirst into the chaotic and thrilling world of **Shadowrun 5th Edition: Splintered State**. If you're into cyberpunk, magic, and enough intrigue to make your head spin faster than a wired reflex, then buckle up. This RPG module promises an adventure filled with danger, double-crosses, and more plot twists than a cheap trid show. So, let's get started!

## Plot Overview

### The Basics

*Splintered State* picks up right after the events of *Storm Front*. Seattle is still reeling from the aftermath, and the players find themselves neck-deep in trouble. The module throws them into a high-stakes game involving megacorporations, shadowy operatives, and even a dragon (because why not?). Your mission? Navigate this mess, avoid getting geeked, and hopefully get paid.

### The Story

The plot kicks off with the players recovering a data chip that everyone and their mother wants. From there, it's a wild ride through Seattle's underbelly. The story is rich with options, allowing players to forge alliances, betray friends, and carve their own path. Just remember, loyalty is for suckers.

## Characters

### NPCs Galore

*Splintered State* is packed with memorable NPCs. There's the enigmatic fixer Mr. Johnson, the ruthless corp exec Ms. Smith, and the charmingly dangerous street samurai Razor. Each character adds depth and flavor to the story, making every interaction a potential minefield—or goldmine.

### Player Characters

Players can take on the roles of seasoned runners or fresh meat. The module offers plenty of opportunities for skill use, from hacking and spellcasting to good old-fashioned gunplay. Your choices will shape the story, so think twice before pulling that trigger—or not, it's Shadowrun, after all.

## Themes

### Intrigue and Betrayal

If there's one thing Shadowrun does well, it's intrigue. *Splintered State* excels in creating a world where trust is a rare commodity. Every ally could be a future enemy, and every deal comes with a catch. It's like playing chess with a loaded gun.

The module dives deep into corporate warfare. Megacorps are pulling strings behind the scenes, manipulating events for their own gain. Players will need to navigate this treacherous landscape carefully, or risk becoming pawns in a much larger game.

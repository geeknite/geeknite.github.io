## What is Black Rose Wars?

Black Rose Wars is a competitive board game set in the dark and mystical world of Nova Aetas. Players take on the roles of powerful mages vying to become the Black Rose's favorite, battling for power and dominance within the Lodge. The game is packed with intricate mechanics, strategic depth, and enough spell cards to make a sorcerer jealous.

### Components

The game includes:

- **Game Board**: A modular board representing different rooms of the Lodge, each with its unique challenges and opportunities.
- **Spell Cards**: A plethora of spell cards categorized into different schools of magic, ensuring no two games are ever the same.
- **Tokens and Markers**: Used to track progress, health, and various effects. Don't let the cat near these, or you might end up with a magically rearranged game.

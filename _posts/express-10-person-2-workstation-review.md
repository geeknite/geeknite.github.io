## First Impressions

As soon as this behemoth arrived, we knew we were dealing with something special. With dimensions coming in at a whopping 9400 x 1530 x 1200 mm, it's not just a workstation – it's a statement. Imagine the IKEA furniture assembly challenge of your worst nightmares, multiply that by 10, and you're halfway there.

### Unboxing Experience

Opening the packaging felt like unraveling a giant Christmas present, albeit one that required a degree in engineering to assemble. The plethora of pieces included screens, desk surfaces, legs, screws, and more screws. The manual was thicker than a George R. R. Martin novel.

## Design & Build Quality

### Aesthetics

The workstation boasts a sleek white finish that's cleaner than a dental clinic. It screams modernity and sophistication, making it perfect for any forward-thinking office. If your goal is to mercilessly taunt your colleagues with your superior taste, this setup will do the job.

### Materials

The materials are top-notch, with sturdy metal legs and high-quality laminate surfaces. You could probably survive a mild earthquake under this desk, although we recommend seeking more traditional safety measures.

## Functionality

### Space Utilization

With 10 individual workstations, this setup is a dream come true for a collaborative environment. Whether you're working on the next big app or planning a heist (we don't judge), there's enough space for everyone.

### Screens

The workstation includes dividers to offer some privacy. They are effective at blocking out the view of your colleague's questionable browsing habits but won't shield you from the smell of their lunch.

### Comfort

Each workstation is spacious enough to prevent elbow wars. However, a word of caution: if you're prone to spinning around in your chair, you might take out a colleague or two due to the close quarters.

## Assembly

### The Struggle

Let's not sugarcoat this – assembling this monster is a Herculean task. If your idea of fun is reading through detailed manuals and sorting through hundreds of screws, you're in for a treat. For the rest of you, investing in professional assembly services is highly recommended.

### Time

Set aside a full day or two for this project. Make sure to have snacks, hydration, and perhaps a motivational playlist to get through the ordeal.

## In Use

### Practicality

Once assembled, the workstation is a marvel. It provides ample space for each person and adds a touch of professional elegance to any office. The screens offer decent privacy, and the white finish is easy to clean, which is a blessing if you have a group of messy eaters.

### Durability

So far, the workstation has held up well. It seems robust enough to last for years, although its sense of pride might take a hit if you ever decide to disassemble it again.

## Comparison with Alternatives

### Competitors

Comparing this workstation to others on the market, it stands out for its size and functionality. While it may not be the easiest to assemble, its design and utility justify the effort. If you're looking for something simpler, you might want to consider alternatives like the **IKEA BEKANT** or **Autonomous SmartDesk**.

## Final Recommendation

### Who Should Buy?

If you have a large team and need a shared workspace that combines style with function, the **Express 10 Person 2 Workstation W Screen** is a solid investment. It’s perfect for tech startups, creative agencies, or anyone who enjoys the camaraderie of a shared environment.

### Who Should Avoid?

If the thought of assembling furniture makes you break out in hives or if you have a small space, this workstation might not be the best fit. There are more straightforward options that will save you time and stress.

## Introduction

Hello, fellow Tarnished! Get ready to dive into the murky, monster-filled world of Elden Ring — where every decision counts, and every mistake might just get you killed. If you have been searching for the ultimate medieval fantasy adventure, look no further. Elden Ring is the game that will have you laughing, screaming, and maybe even crying (if you roll the wrong dice at the wrong time).

## The Basics

### What is Elden Ring?

Elden Ring is an epic action RPG developed by FromSoftware, with collaboration from George R.R. Martin. You and your friends embark on a journey to navigate dangerous dungeons and complete quests. With nearly 95 hours of content in the base game alone, this isn't just a one-night affair. Prepare for an epic journey that you may need several weekends (or years) to complete.

### Components

The game comes with 17 playable characters, each with unique abilities, and hundreds of monsters to battle. You get a gazillion spells, weapons, and items. Don't forget the lore — it's thick enough to be used as a weapon against small intruders.

## The Gameplay

### Setting Up

Setting up Elden Ring is like setting up for a medieval reenactment. It takes time, patience, and maybe a few sacrificial offerings (like your sanity). But once you’ve laid out all the pieces, the real fun begins.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players choose two actions. These actions dictate the moves they can perform that round. These could range from moving and attacking to healing allies or summoning creatures. The top half of one action and the bottom half of another are used, giving players flexibility and strategy.

### Combat

Combat in Elden Ring is a mix of strategic planning and luck. Each attack can be modified by drawing a card from your personal attack modifier deck. Did you plan an epic attack just to draw a card that reduced your damage to zero? Welcome to Elden Ring, where even the best-laid plans can go awry.

## The Story

### Campaign Mode

The storyline progresses as you complete scenarios. It's like reading a fantasy novel, except you're one of the characters, and you can blame your friends if things go south. Spoiler: They will.

### Side Missions & Characters

There are numerous side missions and character-specific quests that add depth and replayability. Characters level up and evolve, which can lead to new abilities and items. Just be careful not to get too attached — characters can retire and leave the game.

## Pros and Cons

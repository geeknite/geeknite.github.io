Alicematic Heroes is a strategic board game set in the fantastical world of Wonderland.

To dominate Wonderland and claim your rightful place as the ultimate hero (or villain, we don't judge).

### Components

The game comes with a variety of beautifully designed components, including character miniatures, cards, and tokens. The artwork is stunning, capturing the essence of Wonderland with vivid colors and intricate details.

## Gameplay

### Setting Up

Setting up Alicematic Heroes is like hosting a tea party with the Queen of Hearts. Lay out the board, distribute characters and cards, and prepare to dive into the chaos of Wonderland.

Combat in Alicematic Heroes is a blend of strategy and luck. Players must coordinate their attacks and special abilities to defeat enemies and complete objectives. Remember, in Wonderland, the unexpected is the norm.

## Introduction

Welcome back, fellow board game enthusiasts! Today, we're diving into the divine realm of the **7 Wonders: Duel - Pantheon Expansion**. If you thought 7 Wonders: Duel couldn't get any better, prepare to be awestruck. This expansion introduces gods, mythological wonders, and enough strategy to make even Zeus say, "Whoa, that's intense!"

Let's embark on this epic journey, filled with divine intervention, tactical decisions, and a sprinkle of humor (because who doesn't enjoy a good laugh while conquering ancient civilizations?).

## What's in the Box?

The Pantheon Expansion comes with a variety of components that fit seamlessly into the base game. Here's what you'll find inside:

- **5 Temple Cards**: These replace the guild cards from the base game.
- **15 Mythology Cards**: Representing different gods from five ancient cultures.
- **2 Pantheon Boards**: To place the gods and interact with them during the game.
- **Divinity Tokens**: For summoning the gods (no, you don't need a blood sacrifice, just these tokens will do).
- **Wonders and Progress Tokens**: Additional elements to enhance your strategic options.

**Pro Tip**: Keep the components organized. The gods may be patient, but your fellow players probably aren't.

## How Does It Change the Game?

### Divine Intervention

The Pantheon Expansion introduces gods from various mythologies, including Greek, Egyptian, and Mesopotamian. These gods can be summoned to provide powerful effects that can turn the tide of the game. For instance, Zeus can destroy an opponent's building, while Isis can give you extra resources. Each god brings a unique ability, adding layers of strategy and complexity.

### New Strategies

With the introduction of gods, players must now consider how to utilize divine powers to their advantage. Should you summon a god early to gain an edge, or save your divinity tokens for a more critical moment? The choice is yours, but remember, the gods are watching (and probably judging your every move).

### Temples and Mythology Cards

The temple cards replace the guild cards from the base game, offering new ways to score points. Meanwhile, mythology cards allow you to interact with the pantheon and manipulate divine powers. These additions create new pathways to victory and force players to adapt their strategies accordingly.

## Gameplay Experience

### Setup

Setting up the Pantheon Expansion is relatively straightforward. The pantheon boards are placed above the main board, and the mythology cards are shuffled and placed nearby. Each player receives divinity tokens and selects their wonders. The temple cards are mixed into the age III deck, replacing the guild cards.

### Turns and Actions

During each turn, players can perform standard actions from the base game, such as building structures or developing science. However, with the Pantheon Expansion, they can also interact with the gods. Using divinity tokens, players can summon gods to unleash their powers, adding an exciting twist to the gameplay.

**Funny Moment**: In one game, a player summoned Zeus to destroy an opponent's military building, only to realize they had accidentally targeted their own. Zeus may have laughed, but the player did not.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- **Increased Depth**: The Pantheon Expansion adds complexity and depth, making each game more strategic and engaging.
- **Replayability**: With different gods and mythology cards, no two games are ever the same.

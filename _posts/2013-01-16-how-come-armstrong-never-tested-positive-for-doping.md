### The Scandal: How Did Armstrong Get Away with It?

After the USADA (U.S. Anti-Doping Agency) released a report accusing Lance Armstrong of doping with "conclusive and irrefutable" evidence, one question remains: **How did he avoid testing positive for so long?**

### The USADA Report: A Web of Lies and Deception

The USADA detailed how Armstrong allegedly avoided detection for years. But let's be clear: the idea that Armstrong never tested positive is **a myth**. Here are some key moments:

1. **1999 Tour de France**: Armstrong tested positive for cortisone but claimed it was due to a lotion. Convenient, right?  
2. **2001 Tour de Suisse**: Teammates Tyler Hamilton and Floyd Landis alleged Armstrong tested positive for EPO but "came to a financial agreement" to hide it.

### The Methods: How Armstrong Allegedly Cheated the System

#### 1. Avoiding Controls  
Armstrong's team reportedly used surveillance to predict drug tests and avoided them by retreating to remote locations like Puigcerd√†, Spain. In one instance, Armstrong even withdrew from a race to dodge a test.

#### 2. Using Undetectable Substances  
Between 1998 and 2005, substances like EPO and testosterone were difficult to detect. Armstrong allegedly exploited this window of opportunity.

#### 3. A "Good" Doctor  
Dr. Michele Ferrari, Armstrong's long-time associate, allegedly advised using hypobaric chambers to mimic the effects of EPO. Talk about taking "doctor's orders" to the next level.

#### 4. Saline Solutions  
One of the boldest claims involves injecting saline to lower hematocrit levels before blood tests. In 1998, Armstrong's doctor reportedly smuggled saline in his coat to administer it discreetly.

### Final Thoughts: A Mixed Legacy

As a cyclist, I'm deeply disappointed by Armstrong's actions. However, his influence brought cycling into the spotlight and inspired many to take up the sport. Today, cycling is more popular than ever, and for that, we can be grateful.

Welcome, noble readers, to a journey back in time to the days of medieval knights, specifically mounted knights from 1200-1350 AD. Grab your sword and shield, and let's dive into this fascinating period filled with chivalry, epic battles, and some good old-fashioned medieval humor.

## Introduction

Ah, the medieval knight—a figure so iconic that even today, their tales of valor and bravery inspire us. From their impressive armor to their trusty steeds, these mounted knights were the epitome of martial prowess and gentlemanly conduct. Of course, they also had their fair share of quirks and, let's be honest, quite a few smelly moments.

## Weaponry and Armor

### Heater Shield

First up, the heater shield. This bad boy was shaped like, well, a heater. Its design was perfect for protecting vital body parts while also being light enough to carry into battle without causing chronic back pain (which wasn't exactly treatable back then).

### Mace or Axe

When it comes to close combat, knights had a choice between the mace and the axe. The mace, resembling a spiky club, was great for delivering blunt force trauma—a medieval version of a migraine inducer. The axe, on the other hand, was perfect for splitting helmets and, occasionally, arguments.

### Sword

No knight's arsenal would be complete without the sword. This versatile weapon was essential for slicing, dicing, and looking dramatically heroic while posing for medieval portraits.

### Helmets and Hooded Cloaks

Knights wore helmets that were as stylish as they were functional. These head protectors came in various designs, including the classic bucket helmet and, for the trendsetters, the more refined visored helmet. As for hooded cloaks, they were the medieval equivalent of wearing sunglasses indoors—cool and mysterious.

## The Noble Steed

### Unarmoured Horse

While knights sometimes donned their horses in armor, the unarmoured horse was the unsung hero of many battles. With agility and speed, these horses helped knights maneuver through the chaos of warfare. Plus, they had less chafing to worry about.

## Knights' Daily Life

Ah, the daily life of a knight—filled with training, jousting, and the occasional dance-off. Knights had a rigorous schedule that included combat practice, maintaining their gear, and ensuring their armor didn't rust (which, let’s be honest, was a full-time job).

## Historical Humor

### The Terrified Tidier

If you're the type of knight who shudders at the sight of even a single bent corner on your shield, then you might relate to the Terrified Tidier. Gone are the days of sweaty palms ruining your battle stance. With a trusty squire to help, you can keep your gear pristine, avoiding clumsy hands and accidental spills.

### The Fashionable Noble

Let's be honest; knights had a touch of elegance to their armor. Just like a tailored suit, premium armor made a statement. You took pride in your meticulously organized and visually stunning ensemble, and your armor was the final touch that tied everything together.

### The Space-Conscious Knight

Your armory is full to the brim, and you need to squeeze every last mace into your racks. This is where unarmoured horses come to the rescue! They ensure that your gear fits perfectly without creating the chaos of oversized racks and wasted space.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, mounted knights from 1200-1350 AD were the quintessential warriors of their time. With their impressive armory, trusty steeds, and a sense of humor, they left a lasting legacy that continues to captivate our imaginations. Whether you're a history buff or just love a good knightly tale, these medieval heroes have undoubtedly earned their place in the annals of history.

## What is Starfinder?

Starfinder is a science fiction role-playing game set in a galaxy teeming with alien races, starships, and cosmic dangers. Think _Dungeons & Dragons_ but with more lasers and fewer dragons (unless you count space dragons, which are totally a thing).

### The Basics

The **Starfinder Core Rulebook** provides everything you need to create characters, build starships, and navigate the universe. From detailed race options to expansive class choices, this rulebook covers it all. Prepare to embark on epic missions, uncover ancient secrets, and maybe even save the galaxy!

## Gameplay

### Character Creation

# Atari Boardgames: Centipede Review

## Introduction

Welcome, retro gaming enthusiasts and board game lovers! Today, we're venturing into the pixelated past to explore **Atari's Centipede Board Game**. Remember the hours spent dodging and shooting those relentless centipedes on your Atari console? Well, now you can relive that excitement on your tabletop. Spoiler alert: You might want to keep a can of bug spray handy!

## The Basics

### What's in the Box?

The Centipede board game comes with a colorful game board, an array of centipede and garden gnome miniatures, dice, and a deck of action cards. The bright artwork and quality components will transport you back to the golden age of arcade gaming. You’ll feel like you’ve opened a time capsule from 1981.

**Fun Fact**: The game even includes a miniature version of the classic trackball controller! Okay, it doesn’t actually work, but it’s a nice touch.

### Game Setup

Setting up Centipede is quick and straightforward. Players select their gnome avatars, set up the centipedes at the top of the board, and shuffle the action cards. The objective is simple: be the first to defeat the centipede and save your garden.

**Pro Tip**: Make sure the centipedes are evenly spaced to start. We had one game where all the centipedes bunched up on one side, leading to a massacre of gnomish proportions.

## Gameplay

### Turn Phases

Each turn in Centipede consists of several phases:

1. **Movement Phase**: Roll the dice to move your gnome across the board.
2. **Attack Phase**: Use action cards to shoot at the centipedes. If you hit, you can remove a segment of the centipede.
3. **Centipede Phase**: The centipedes move down the board, inching closer to your gnome. If they reach you, it’s game over.

### Winning the Game

To win, you must be the first player to destroy the entire centipede before it reaches your gnome. It’s a race against time and a test of your strategic card play and dice rolling skills.

**Pro Tip**: Save your most powerful action cards for the final showdown. You’ll need every bit of firepower to take down the centipede before it’s too late.

## Strategy and Fun Factor

Centipede is a blend of luck and strategy. The dice rolls add an element of chance, while the action cards provide strategic depth. You’ll need to think several moves ahead and decide the best times to use your cards. The game also includes some hilarious moments, like when your gnome gets cornered and you have to pull off a miraculous escape.

**Funny Moment**: During one game, a player rolled three consecutive ones, resulting in their gnome moving less than an inch. The centipede practically walked over and said, “Hello, lunch!”

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- **Nostalgic Appeal**: Recaptures the magic of the original arcade game.
- **High-Quality Components**: Beautiful artwork and sturdy miniatures.
- **Quick Setup and Gameplay**: Easy to learn and perfect for short gaming sessions.
- **Humor and Fun**: Provides plenty of laugh-out-loud moments.

### Cons

- **Luck-Dependent**: Heavy reliance on dice rolls might frustrate strategic players.
- **Limited Player Interaction**: Mostly a solo challenge against the centipede, with minimal interaction between players.
- **Repetitive**: Gameplay can become repetitive after multiple plays.

## Final Thoughts

Atari’s Centipede board game is a delightful trip down memory lane. It captures the essence of the original video game while adding a social, tabletop twist. Whether you’re a fan of the classic arcade game or just looking for a fun, quick-play board game, Centipede delivers a healthy dose of nostalgia and excitement.

[![Xbox Series S](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61nq7mC0tHL.jpg){: .align-right}]({{ site.constants.wsib }}xbox-series-s)

Ah, the Xbox Series S. The console that's been giving PlayStation a run for its money since the early 2000s. But here we are in 2025, and the gaming world has changed dramatically. So, is the Xbox Series S still worth your hard-earned cash? Let's dive deep into the world of Xbox and find out.

## Hardware: A Beast or a Bust?

First things first, let's talk hardware. The Xbox Series S is an absolute beast. With specs that could make your gaming PC blush, it's got everything you need to run the latest and greatest games without breaking a sweat.

| Feature              | Xbox Series S                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| **CPU**             | AMD Zen 2 8 cores            |
| **GPU**             | 4 Teraflops                 |
| **RAM**             | 10GB GDDR6                   |
| **Storage**         | 512GB NVMe SSD (expandable)    |

**The reality?** While the specs are impressive, the real question is: can it handle the heat of your mom's basement during an intense gaming session? That remains to be seen.

## The Good

### Graphics and Performance

The Xbox Series S is designed for 1440p gaming and up to 120 FPS. While it's not the 4K beast like its sibling, the Series X, it still delivers stunning visuals and smooth gameplay. It's like having a mini supercomputer in your living room. Just don't ask it to do your taxes.

### Game Library

The Xbox boasts an impressive game library. From the latest AAA titles to indie gems, there's something for everyone. Whether you're into first-person shooters or farming simulators (yes, we see you, Stardew Valley fans), Xbox has got you covered.

### Game Pass

Xbox Game Pass is like Netflix for gamers. With a vast library of games available for a monthly fee, you won't run out of games to play anytime soon. Your backlog will become a black hole of endless entertainment.

## The Bad

### Storage

While the Xbox Series S offers 512GB of storage, it's surprising how quickly it fills up. Between game installations and updates, you'll find yourself needing more space. Time to invest in an external hard drive.

### No Disc Drive

The Xbox Series S is all-digital, which means no physical discs. If you're nostalgic about collecting game boxes or have a stash of old Xbox games, this might be a deal-breaker.

### Performance Compared to Series X

While the Series S is a great console, it doesn't quite match the raw power of the Series X. If you're a graphics snob or want the very best performance, you might need to dig a little deeper into your pockets.

## The Ugly

### The Design

The Xbox Series S looks like an oversized kitchen timer. It's compact and minimalist, but it's hard not to make the comparison. On the bright side, it fits snugly in small spaces, perfect for dorms or apartments.

### Controller Battery Life

The Xbox controllers are great, but the battery life? Not so much. Get ready to stock up on AA batteries or invest in rechargeable ones. Either way, you'll be swapping batteries more often than you'd like.

## Final Recommendation

Overall, the Xbox Series S is an excellent console. It offers fantastic performance, a vast game library, and backward compatibility. Sure, it has its downsides, but what console doesn't? If you're a dedicated gamer, this is a worthy investment.

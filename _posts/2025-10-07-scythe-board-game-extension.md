## Introduction

Welcome, mighty gamers and Scythe enthusiasts! Today, we're venturing into the expanded world of **Scythe** with its epic **Game Board Extension**. If you've ever felt the need for more space to dominate territories, strategize, and gather resources, then this extension is your passport to an even grander adventure. Prepare yourselves for larger maps, more strategic options, and the occasional “Wait, where did my piece go?” moment.

## What is the Scythe Game Board Extension?

The Scythe Game Board Extension is exactly what it sounds like—an extension for the original Scythe game board that allows for larger gameplay. Created by **Stonemaier Games**, this extension is perfect for players who crave more room for their mechs, workers, and resources. It essentially doubles the size of the original game board, giving you ample space to execute your master plans.

### Components

The extension comes with a beautifully designed board that you can combine with your existing Scythe game board. The artwork is meticulously detailed, capturing the essence of the dystopian landscape that makes Scythe so visually compelling. Additionally, it includes extra hex tiles and various tokens to mark territories and resources.

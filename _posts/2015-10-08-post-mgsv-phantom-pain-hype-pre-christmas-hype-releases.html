Fall is here and after the review-successful and<em>hypeful</em>
<a href="https://www.putinyourbasket.com/mgsv%20phantom%20pain">MGSV Phantom Pain</a>, which I haven't finally bought because as you may know <a href="/2012/04/dont-buy-dlc-buy-goty-or-nothing.html">I'm not a fan of hype</a>, and that has disappointed many for its story but not for its initial gameplay, a mix inspired by many features of other games, and I can't but praise it, many AAA games are around the corner. We can't forget <a href="{{ site.constants[0].wsib }}/us/mad%20max">Mad Max</a> on the other hand had some good ideas as a new franchise but didn't execute as well, models lacked reality and Max was but a caricature of the Max from the movies, but we should point that the apocalyptic setting with cars and brawling works very well (note it <a href="{{ site.constants[0].wsib }}/us/fallout%204">Fallout 4</a>, we want to have a car also) and we will be waiting for a <a href="https://www.putinyourbasket.com/mad%20max%202">Mad Max 2</a>.<br />
But what motivates this post is the myriad of great games that are coming:<br />
<h2 id="fallout-4">
<a href="{{ site.constants[0].wsib }}/us/fallout%204">Fallout 4</a>
</h2>My favorite of all, I am a big fan of the saga and <a href="/2012/04/fallout-4-problems-to-overcome-and-what-should-we-expect.html">I already was craving for Fallout 4 a few years back</a>. I love the setting, I will love the crafting, Meatdog and the story but what I fear most is the gameplay, after playing FPS games like <a href="https://www.putinyourbasket.com/far%20cry">Far Cry</a> where gameplay was impressive and after the release of MGSV that mixed many of modern shooter features that impressed us makes me fear that Fallout 4's gameplay may have got obsolete even before its release, we will be more than expecting. <strong>A must buy for me</strong>, a shame that I couldn't get my hands on the <a href="https://www.putinyourbasket.com/pipboy%20edition">PipBoy Edition</a>.<br />
<h2 id="star-wars-battlefront">
<a href="https://www.putinyourbasket.com/Star%20Wars%20Battlefront">Star Wars Battlefront</a>
</h2>A classic saga that gets rebooted and with a stunning visuals that will make most of the Star Wars fan base drool. I am not much into multiplayer games so here I will be waiting for how it manages in the reviews.<br />
<h2 id="call-of-duty-black-ops-iii">
<a href="https://www.putinyourbasket.com/Call%20of%20Duty%20Black%20Ops%20III">Call of Duty: Black Ops III</a>
</h2>Another annual cut series that could not miss its date with this Fall, this time with a required renewal for multiplayer mode and improved graphics that will make it one of the most visually impressive titles we will be able to play. Not my kind of game but I can recognize its visual quality that makes the game industry step every year a little further.<br />
<h2 id="more-games-coming">More games coming!</h2>And more interesting games are coming, maybe they are not the most anticipated, but they are promising and must be followed. Next installments in consolidated sagas like , <a href="{{ site.constants[0].wsib }}/us/Assassins%20Creed%20Syndicate">Assassin's Creed: Syndicate</a>,<a href="{{ site.constants[0].wsib }}/us/Just%20Cause%203" rel="nofollow">Just Cause 3</a>,<a href="{{ site.constants[0].wsib }}/us/Halo%205%20Guardians" rel="nofollow">Halo 5: Guardians</a>,<a href="{{ site.constants[0].wsib }}/us/Rise%20of%20the%20Tomb%20Raider" rel="nofollow">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a>,<a href="{{ site.constants[0].wsib }}/us/Tales%20of%20Zestiria" rel="nofollow">Tales of Zestiria</a>,<a href="{{ site.constants[0].wsib }}/us/Rainbow%20Six%20Siege" rel="nofollow">Rainbow Six: Siege</a>,<a href="{{ site.constants[0].wsib }}/us/Need%20for%20Speed" rel="nofollow">Need for Speed</a>. Nintendo exclusive games like <a href="{{ site.constants[0].wsib }}/us/The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda%20Tri%20Force%20Heroes">The Legend of Zelda: Tri Force Heroes</a> and <a href="{{ site.constants[0].wsib }}/us/Xenoblade%20Chronicles%20X">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a>. Stay tuned!

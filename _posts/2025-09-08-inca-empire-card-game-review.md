## Introduction: The Rise of the Incan Civilization on Your Tabletop

Greetings, fellow cardboard conquerors! Today, we embark on a journey through the Andes with **Inca Empire: The Card Game**. Does this game capture the grandeur and complexity of the Incan civilization, or does it leave you feeling like an unprepared llama herder at Machu Picchu? Let's find out!

Having played a variety of historical and strategy games, from the ancient pyramids in **Ra** to the medieval battlegrounds of **Carcassonne**, I was excited to see how Inca Empire would stack up. Spoiler: There are no llamas, but plenty of strategic depth!

## What is Inca Empire: The Card Game?

Inca Empire: The Card Game is a strategic card game where players take on the roles of Incan rulers, expanding their territories, building monuments, and managing resources to gain the favor of the gods and earn the most victory points.

### Components

The game comes with:
- A beautifully illustrated deck of cards depicting various aspects of the Incan Empire.
- Resource tokens, including gold, stone, and food.
- Player boards for tracking progress and resources.
- A rulebook that might as well be a historical novel (but in a good way).

**Pro Tip:** Keep the resource tokens away from small children and pets. My dog tried to eat the 'food' tokens. He was not pleased.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up Inca Empire: The Card Game is straightforward. Each player receives a player board, a set of starting resource tokens, and a hand of cards. Shuffle the main deck and place it in the center. You're now ready to rise to power!

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players draw cards and use them to perform actions such as exploring new territories, constructing buildings, and trading resources. The game emphasizes resource management and strategic planning, as each decision can have long-term consequences.

**Pro Tip:** Always keep an eye on your resource levels. Running out of food can lead to unrest among your people, and nobody wants an angry mob with llamas.

### Scoring and Winning

Victory points are earned by expanding your territory, building monuments, and successfully completing various objectives. The player with the most victory points at the end of the game wins and is declared the greatest Incan ruler of all time.

## Gameplay Experience

### Strategic Depth

Inca Empire: The Card Game offers a rich strategic experience. The interplay between resource management, territory expansion, and monument construction requires careful planning and foresight. It's like a game of chess, but with more llamas and less existential dread.

### Player Interaction

The game includes plenty of opportunities for interaction. Players can trade resources, compete for territory, and even sabotage each other's plans. It's a delicate balance of cooperation and competition that keeps the game engaging from start to finish.

**Funny Moment:** During one game, I managed to convince another player to trade me all their gold for a single food token. They were desperate, and I felt like an Incan Robin Hood (if Robin Hood hoarded gold and laughed maniacally).

### Replayability

With different strategies to explore and various ways to score points, Inca Empire: The Card Game offers high replayability. No two games are ever the same, ensuring that players will keep coming back for more.

## Comparison with Other Strategy Games

### [Ra]({{ site.constants.wsib }}ra)

Ra is a game of ancient Egyptian auctions and tile drafting. While both games offer rich historical themes and strategic depth, Inca Empire focuses more on resource management and territory expansion.

### [Carcassonne]({{ site.constants.wsib }}carcassonne)

Carcassonne is a tile-placement game set in medieval France. Both games emphasize strategic planning, but Inca Empire adds a layer of resource management that Carcassonne lacks.

## Pros and Cons

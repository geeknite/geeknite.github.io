Kodama: The Tree Spirits is a beautiful and relaxing game where players grow trees by placing branch cards in the most aesthetically pleasing way possible. Sounds simple, right? Well, like any good gardener knows, there's a bit more to it than meets the eye.

## Gameplay Overview

Kodama is a card placement game for 2-5 players, where each player tries to create the most lush and appealing tree by placing branch cards. The game is played over three seasons, each consisting of four rounds. The ultimate goal is to earn points based on how well you match symbols on the branch cards and cater to the whims of the Kodama spirits.

### Setup

Setting up Kodama is a breeze. Each player receives a trunk card to start their tree, and a hand of branch cards. The branch cards are shuffled and placed in a draw pile. The Kodama cards, which offer special scoring opportunities, are also shuffled and set aside for later use.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players draw a branch card and add it to their tree, ensuring that the symbols on the cards match. The symbols include flowers, clouds, insects, and mushrooms, each representing different aspects of the tree's ecosystem. Players earn points based on the number of matching symbols they connect.

At the end of each season, players choose a Kodama spirit card that offers bonus points based on specific conditions. For example, a Kodama might reward extra points for having a certain number of flowers or mushrooms on your tree.

### Scoring

Scoring in Kodama is a delicate balance of strategy and aesthetics. Players must consider the placement of each branch card to maximize points while creating a visually appealing tree. The Kodama spirit cards add an extra layer of strategy, as players must plan ahead to meet the conditions for bonus points.

## Components

Kodama: The Tree Spirits boasts beautiful artwork and high-quality components that enhance the gaming experience. The branch cards feature whimsical illustrations of flowers, insects, and other elements, making each tree unique and visually stunning. The trunk cards and Kodama spirit cards are equally charming, adding to the game's overall appeal.

**Criticism Alert**: While the artwork is breathtaking, some players might find the symbols on the cards a bit small, making them harder to see for those with poor eyesight. Consider investing in a magnifying glass if you're feeling extra fancy!

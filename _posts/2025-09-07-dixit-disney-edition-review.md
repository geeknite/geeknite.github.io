## Introduction

Welcome, Disney enthusiasts and board game lovers! Today, we’re diving into the enchanting world of **Dixit Disney Edition**. If you’re familiar with the original Dixit, you know it’s a game full of creativity, beautiful artwork, and a bit of mystery. Now, add a sprinkle of Disney magic, and voila! You've got Dixit Disney Edition. Prepare for a whimsical journey where imagination meets iconic Disney tales.

## What is Dixit Disney Edition?

Dixit Disney Edition is a family-friendly board game that combines the classic storytelling elements of Dixit with the beloved characters and scenes from Disney movies. Players use beautifully illustrated cards to tell stories and guess each other's choices, all while immersing themselves in the world of Disney.

### The Basics

In Dixit Disney Edition, players take turns being the storyteller. The storyteller chooses one of their cards and gives a clue inspired by the card. The other players then select one of their cards that best matches the clue. The cards are shuffled and revealed, and everyone tries to guess which card was the storyteller's. Points are awarded based on correct guesses and how well the clue matched the card.

### Components

The game comes with:

- **Illustrated Cards**: Stunning cards featuring scenes from various Disney movies.
- **Game Board**: A magical track for keeping score.
- **Voting Tokens**: To cast your guesses.
- **Rule Book**: Clear instructions, but let's be honest, half the fun is figuring out your own house rules!

**Pro Tip**: Don't let your cat near the cards. Those claws are the real villains here.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up Dixit Disney Edition is quick and easy. Shuffle the cards, distribute voting tokens, and place the score markers on the board. Choose a player to be the first storyteller, and you're ready to begin your magical adventure.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, the storyteller gives a clue based on one of their cards. The other players select their cards that best fit the clue, and these cards are revealed and shuffled. Players then vote on which card they think is the storyteller's. Points are awarded based on correct guesses and creativity of the clues.

### Scoring

Points are awarded as follows:

- Correctly guessing the storyteller's card earns points.
- The storyteller earns points if their clue is well-received and correctly guessed.
- Bonus points for players whose cards were mistaken for the storyteller's.

## The Disney Magic

### Artwork and Illustrations

One of the best parts of Dixit Disney Edition is the breathtaking artwork. The cards feature scenes from classic and modern Disney movies, from Cinderella’s castle to Elsa’s ice palace. The illustrations are so enchanting, you might just forget you're playing a game!

**Funny Moment**: During one game, our group was so captivated by a card depicting Simba on Pride Rock that we all gave clues related to animals. Turns out, the storyteller's clue was actually about leadership. Hakuna Matata, right?

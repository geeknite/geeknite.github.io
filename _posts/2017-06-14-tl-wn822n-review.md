Today, we're diving into the world of budget-friendly Wi-Fi adapters with the **TP-Link TL-WN822N**. It's affordable, functional, and might just be the missing link between you and seamless connectivity. Let's see if it lives up to the hype (and the numerous promises on the box). Spoiler alert: there's Wi-Fi, and there's a lot of it. Let's jump into this review, shall we?

## What is the TP-Link TL-WN822N?

The **TP-Link TL-WN822N** is a USB Wi-Fi adapter that supports wireless speeds of up to 300Mbps. It's designed to enhance your computer's Wi-Fi connectivity, especially if your built-in adapter is, well, less than impressive. Think of it as the geeky sidekick to your internet woesâ€”ready to swoop in and save the day.

## Pros

### Affordable and Effective

Let's start with the most obvious pro: the price. At under $20, the TL-WN822N is a steal. It's like finding a $20 bill in your jacket pocket from last winter. Itâ€™s budget-friendly and provides excellent value for the cost. Your wallet will thank you.

### Easy Setup

Setting up this Wi-Fi adapter is as easy as pie. Actually, easier than pieâ€”because who really knows how to make pie from scratch? Just plug it in, install the drivers (which can be downloaded from the TP-Link website if the included CD feels too 90s for you), and boom! You're connected. And no, you donâ€™t need a degree in computer science for this.

### Strong and Reliable Connection

Despite its small size, this little gadget packs a punch. It provides a strong and reliable connection, even through walls and other obstacles. It's like the superhero of Wi-Fi adapters, minus the cape. If your router is in the living room and youâ€™re gaming in the basement, the TL-WN822N wonâ€™t let you down.

## Cons

### Bulky Design

While the TL-WN822N is certainly effective, it's not the most discreet device out there. It's a bit bulky and might look odd sticking out of your laptop like a small satellite dish. If aesthetics matter to you, this might be a minor gripe.

### No 5GHz Support

One of the drawbacks of this adapter is that it doesn't support the 5GHz band. In a world where dual-band routers are becoming the norm, this is a bit of a letdown. You'll be stuck on the 2.4GHz band, which means you might encounter more interference from other devices. On the bright side, itâ€™s a great reminder that life isnâ€™t always perfect, right?

### Limited Range

Although the connection is strong, the range is somewhat limited. If you live in a mansion (lucky you), you might find that the TL-WN822N struggles to maintain a connection in rooms far from the router. For us mere mortals in average-sized homes, it should work just fine.

## Performance

In terms of performance, the TL-WN822N delivers as promised. It maintains a stable connection (as stable as a cat walking on a tightrope) and provides decent speeds for everyday tasks like browsing, streaming, and gaming. It's not going to win any speed championships, but for the price, itâ€™s hard to beat.

## Installation and Setup

Installing the TL-WN822N is a breeze. Simply plug it into a USB port on your computer, install the necessary drivers, and youâ€™re good to go. The device comes with a CD containing the drivers, but if youâ€™re like me and havenâ€™t owned a CD drive since 2010, you can download them from the TP-Link website. It's a straightforward process that even your tech-challenged aunt could handle.

## Geeky Features

For the geeks among us (and let's face it, that's most of us), the TL-WN822N has a few nifty features worth mentioning:

- **MIMO Technology**: Multiple Input, Multiple Output technology enhances data throughput and range, making your Wi-Fi experience smoother than ever.
- **WPS Button**: The Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) button allows you to connect to your router with just a push of a button. No need to remember those pesky passwords.
- **Detachable Antenna**: The two external antennas are detachable, allowing for easy replacement or upgrade if you want to boost your signal further.

### [ASUS USB-AC68]({% post_url 2023-03-26-asus-usb-ac68-review %})
The ASUS USB-AC68 is another high-end adapter that offers dual-band support and impressive speeds. It's more expensive than the TL-WN822N but provides a more robust performance. If you need a reliable connection for gaming or streaming, the USB-AC68 is worth the investment.

It's easy to set up, provides a strong and reliable connection, and has a few geeky features that make it stand out.

## Game Components

Let's start with the components. Isle of Trains: All Aboard comes with a beautifully designed board, train cards, cargo tokens, and passenger meeples. The artwork is charming and captures the essence of a bustling train station.

### Train Cards

Players use train cards to build their locomotives, adding carriages and upgrades as the game progresses. These cards are the heart of the game, determining your train's capabilities and scoring potential.

### Cargo Tokens

Cargo tokens represent the goods your train will deliver throughout the game. Managing these tokens efficiently is key to maximizing your score.

### Passenger Meeples

Passenger meeples add an extra layer of strategy, as players must decide when to prioritize cargo or passengers to gain the most points.

**Criticism Alert:** While the components are high quality, some players might find the small tokens a bit fiddly to manage during intense gameplay. Keep a steady hand, or you might derail your plans!

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Building Your Train

At the start of the game, each player receives a basic locomotive and a few train cards. As the game progresses, players can add carriages and upgrades to their train, increasing its capacity and efficiency.

**Pro Tip:** Focus on building a balanced train with a mix of cargo and passenger carriages. This will give you more flexibility in scoring points.

### Delivering Cargo and Passengers

The core of Isle of Trains: All Aboard is delivering cargo and passengers to various destinations on the board. Players must carefully plan their routes and manage their resources to maximize their deliveries.

**Funny Moment:** During one game, a player loaded up their train with passengers but forgot to leave room for cargo. Their train looked like a clown car, and the resulting laughter was only matched by their frantic attempts to rectify the situation.

### Upgrading Your Train

Upgrading your train is essential for success. Players can add new carriages, improve their locomotive's speed, and gain special abilities to outmaneuver their opponents.

**Criticism Alert:** Some players might find the upgrade system a bit overwhelming at first. Don't worry; you'll get the hang of it after a few rounds of trial and error.

### Route Planning

Planning your routes is another key aspect. The board features various destinations, each with different rewards and challenges. Players must navigate these routes to optimize their deliveries.

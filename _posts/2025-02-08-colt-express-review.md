## What is Colt Express?

**Colt Express** is a board game designed by Christophe Raimbault and published by Ludonaute.

The game is played over several rounds, each consisting of two phases: scheming and action.

## Components

The game includes:

- **Train Cars**: Beautifully designed 3D cardboard train cars where all the action takes place.
- **Character Cards**: Six colorful bandit characters, each with unique abilities.
- **Loot Tokens**: Various tokens representing money bags, jewels, and strongboxes.
- **Marshal**: A miniature representing the law-enforcing Marshal.
- **Action Cards**: Cards used to plan and execute your bandit's moves.

**Pro Tip**: If you find yourself getting too attached to your bandit character, just remember—they're all out to steal your loot. Trust no one!

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Scheming Phase

During the scheming phase, players take turns playing action cards to a shared pile, planning their moves for the round. These actions include moving through the train cars, picking up loot, punching other bandits, shooting rivals, and dodging the Marshal. The chaos starts here as players try to predict and outmaneuver each other's plans.

### Action Phase

Once all action cards are played, the action phase begins. Players resolve the actions in the order they were played, leading to hilarious and unpredictable outcomes. Did you plan to punch a rival only to find they've moved to another car? Expect plenty of laughs and frustration as your well-laid plans go off the rails.

**Funny Moment**: In one game, a player attempted to shoot another bandit, only to find themselves accidentally shooting the Marshal instead. The resulting chaos had everyone in stitches.

## The Experience

### Strategy and Chaos

Colt Express strikes a perfect balance between strategy and chaos. While careful planning is rewarded, the unpredictable nature of the action phase means even the best-laid plans can go hilariously wrong. This blend keeps the game exciting and engaging, making every round a new adventure.

Whether you're punching a rival, shooting your nemesis, or stealing loot from under someone's nose, Colt Express ensures players are constantly engaged with one another.

## What is Stuka Leader Core Game?

Stuka Leader Core Game is a solitaire strategy game that places you in command of a squadron of German Stuka dive bombers during World War II. Your mission? To complete various objectives while dealing with the chaos of war. It's like chess, but with more explosions and fewer knights.

### Components

The game comes with:
- **Miniatures**: Detailed miniatures of Stuka dive bombers and enemy units.
- **Cards**: A plethora of cards representing missions, events, and strategic options.
- **Game Board**: A beautifully designed board depicting various wartime locations.
- **Tokens and Markers**: Used to track progress, damage, and other game elements.

**Pro Tip**: Don't let your dog near the miniatures. They may think they're chew toys, and nobody wants a slobbery Stuka.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up Stuka Leader Core Game is like preparing for a real military campaign. Lay out the game board, distribute cards and miniatures, and select your mission. Now you're ready to dive bomb into action.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, you draw cards and take actions based on your strategic decisions. You can move your bombers, attack enemy units, and complete objectives. Cooperation isn't necessary because it's a solo game—but hey, talking to yourself can be surprisingly therapeutic.

### Combat

Combat involves strategy, planning, and a bit of luck. Roll dice to determine the outcome of your attacks, and watch as your enemies (hopefully) crumble under your air superiority. Did you plan a perfect bombing run just to have your dice betray you? Welcome to the fog of war!

## Gameplay Experience

Playing Stuka Leader feels like directing a high-stakes mission from the comfort of your living room. The tension is palpable, every decision feels critical, and the satisfaction of a successful mission is unmatched. Whether you're bombarding enemy positions or dodging anti-aircraft fire, the excitement keeps you engaged.

Stuka Leader shines in solo play. Unlike most games where you're arguing with friends over rules, here you're arguing with yourself. And let's be real, you always win those arguments.

## What's Inside the Box?

The Start Collecting Skitarii Adeptus Mechanicus box set is an absolute treasure trove of mechanical mayhem. Here’s what you get:

- 1x Tech-Priest Dominus
- 10x Skitarii Rangers or Vanguard
- 1x Onager Dunecrawler

Each of these units brings a unique edge to your army, combining firepower, mobility, and that signature Adeptus Mechanicus flair for all things mechanical and slightly terrifying.

### Tech-Priest Dominus

The Tech-Priest Dominus is the brains of your operation. Think of him as the mad scientist with an unhealthy obsession with toasters, armed to the teeth with techy gadgets and weapons. He's not just here to look menacing; his abilities can significantly enhance your Skitarii units, making him a must-have on the battlefield.

### Skitarii Rangers/Vanguard

Next up, the Skitarii Rangers or Vanguard. These guys are the bread and butter of your army. The choice between Rangers and Vanguard depends on your strategy. Rangers are masters of long-range combat, while Vanguard prefers to get up close and personal with their Radium Carbines. Whichever path you choose, these units are versatile and deadly.

### Onager Dunecrawler

Last but not least, the Onager Dunecrawler. This mechanical behemoth is your go-to for heavy support. It's got options for a variety of devastating weaponry, from the Eradication Beamer to the Neutron Laser. Plus, it looks like a crab on steroids, which is always a bonus.

## Building the Models

Building the models in this box set is a journey in itself. Here's a quick guide to ensure you don't end up with more glue on your hands than on the models.

### Tools You'll Need

- Plastic glue
- Clippers
- Hobby knife
- Patience (lots of it)

### Assembly Tips

1. **Tech-Priest Dominus**: Start with the Tech-Priest. The assembly is straightforward, but pay attention to the small parts. It’s like building a tiny Ikea wardrobe with a PhD in robotics.

2. **Skitarii Rangers/Vanguard**: Next, move on to the Skitarii. Deciding between Rangers and Vanguard can be tough, but you can always magnetize the arms if you want to switch between them. Just kidding, that’s only for the truly geeky. Either way, enjoy the process and try not to lose any bits.

3. **Onager Dunecrawler**: Finally, tackle the Onager Dunecrawler. This model is a bit more complex, but the instructions are clear. Take your time, and you’ll have a mechanized monstrosity ready to roll across the battlefield in no time.

## Painting the Models

Once your models are assembled, it's time to bring them to life with some paint. Here's a basic guide to get you started.

### Priming

Priming is essential. Use a black or grey primer to give your models a solid base coat. This helps the paint adhere better and makes the colors pop.

### Basic Colors

- **Red for the robes**: Adeptus Mechanicus loves their red robes. Use a rich red for the main color.
- **Metallics for the machinery**: Silver and bronze are your friends here. Use them to pick out the mechanical parts.
- **Details**: Pick out the finer details with a fine brush. Don’t forget the glowing green or blue for the lenses and tech bits.

### Washes and Highlights

To give your models depth, use washes like Nuln Oil or Agrax Earthshade. Apply it liberally, then highlight the raised areas with lighter shades of your base colors.

## Gameplay and Strategy

Now that your models are ready for battle, let's talk strategy.

### Tech-Priest Dominus on the Field

Your Tech-Priest Dominus should stay close to your Skitarii units. Use his abilities to boost their performance and repair your Onager Dunecrawler when it takes damage. He's like the ultimate support character, but with a tendency to zap things into oblivion.

### Skitarii Rangers/Vanguard Tactics

- **Rangers**: Keep them at a distance and use their long-range weapons to pick off enemies from afar.
- **Vanguard**: Use them to advance quickly and engage the enemy up close. Their Radium Carbines can dish out serious damage.

### Onager Dunecrawler's Role

Position your Onager Dunecrawler to provide heavy fire support. It's great for taking out enemy tanks and monstrous creatures. Use its variety of weapons to adapt to different threats.

## Pros and Cons

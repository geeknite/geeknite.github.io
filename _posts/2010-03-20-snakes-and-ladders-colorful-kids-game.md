### What is Snakes and Ladders?

Snakes and Ladders is a classic board game that dates back to ancient India, where it was known as Moksha Patam. The game is simple: players roll a dice and move their tokens along a numbered grid, aiming to reach the top first. Along the way, they encounter ladders that help them advance and snakes that send them back. It's a game of pure luck, with no strategy required – just roll the dice and let fate decide!

### Components

The Colorful Kids Game version of Snakes and Ladders includes:

- **Game Board**: A beautifully illustrated board featuring vibrant colors and whimsical artwork.

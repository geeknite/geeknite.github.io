## What is the Middle-Earth Strategy Battle Game?

### The Basics

The Middle-Earth Strategy Battle Game is a tabletop war game that allows players to recreate iconic battles from J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-Earth. Whether you're leading the forces of Gondor, commanding the armies of Mordor, or simply trying to escape a band of angry Orcs, there's something for everyone.

### Components

The game comes with beautifully crafted miniatures, terrain pieces, and a rulebook thicker than the combined works of Tolkien. Each miniature is meticulously detailed, from the grim expression on Aragorn's face to the menacing grin of the Witch-king.

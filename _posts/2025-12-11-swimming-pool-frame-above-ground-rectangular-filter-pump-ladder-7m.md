## Setup

### Assembly

Let's start with the setup because nobody wants to spend an eternity assembling a pool when they could be splashing about. The assembly process is quite straightforward. It's like playing with LEGO, but this time, the stakes are higher because water is involved. The instruction manual is user-friendly, and all parts are clearly labeled.

Just a tip: Get a friend to help you because, as they say, two brains are better than one, especially when dealing with a 7-meter pool.

### Filling the Pool

Once your masterpiece is assembled, it's time to fill it up. Be prepared for your water bill to look like you’ve been hosting a small ocean in your backyard. But hey, it's totally worth it!

## Features

### Filter Pump

The included filter pump has a flow rate of 2,006 L/h, which ensures your pool stays cleaner longer. No one likes swimming in a pool that looks like a swamp, right?

### Ladder

The ladder is sturdy and tall enough to make climbing in and out easy, even if you're carrying one too many margaritas. It’s also removable, so you can prevent unauthorized midnight pool parties.

### Durability

The pool’s frame is rust-resistant metal, and the walls are made from heavy-duty PVC and polyester, making it durable enough to withstand both cannonballs and the occasional summer storm.

## Performance

The filter pump keeps the water circulating and clean. You might want to add chlorine and check the pH levels occasionally, but overall, maintenance is pretty low-key.

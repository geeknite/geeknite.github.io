### Fit and Comfort

They stay put during intense workouts, and you might even forget you're wearing them (until someone tries to talk to you, and you respond with a loud "Huh?").

## Audio Quality: Ear Candy

### Sound Performance

The **AirPods Pro 3** deliver a sound experience that's akin to having a personal DJ mixing tracks directly in your brain. The highs are crisp, the mids are clear, and the bass... oh, the bass! It's like a tiny subwoofer in each ear.

### Active Noise Cancellation

Remember that one time you tried to meditate, but the neighbor's dog wouldn't shut up? With the **AirPods Pro 3**, external noise becomes a thing of the past. The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is so good you'll think you've entered a soundproof zen bubble. Perfect for ignoring your responsibilities, I mean, focusing on your work.

### Transparency Mode

Switch to Transparency Mode, and it's like having superhuman hearing. You can eavesdrop on conversations from across the room while pretending to listen to your boss on a video call. It's like being a spy, but without the risk of getting caught.

## Features and Battery Life

Apple's Spatial Audio technology makes you feel like you're in the middle of an action movie or your favorite band's live concert. It's immersive, it's magical, and it might just make you forget you're sitting on a crowded train.

### Battery Life

The **AirPods Pro 3** boast up to 6 hours of listening time on a single charge, with a total of 30 hours when you include the charging case. That's more than enough to power through your workday, workout, and wind-down time without searching for a charger.

Pairing the **AirPods Pro 3** with your Apple devices is as effortless as ever. Open the case near your iPhone, and voila! You're connected. They also seamlessly switch between your Apple devices, so you can go from listening to music on your iPad to taking a call on your iPhone without missing a beat.

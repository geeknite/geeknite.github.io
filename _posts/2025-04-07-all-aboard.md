## Ticket to Ride

### Basics of the Game

Collect cards, claim routes, and complete your tickets to become the ultimate railway magnate.

### Gameplay

The simplicity of Ticket to Ride is what makes it so appealing. Collect colored train cards, lay tracks on the board, and complete routes to score points. But beware, other players may cut you off and leave you with a route that resembles a drunken snake.

**Funny Moment:** Ever tried building a route across Siberia only to realize you're one card short? Watch your friends laugh as you frantically search for that elusive orange train card.

## Railways of the World

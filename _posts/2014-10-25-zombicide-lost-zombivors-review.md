## The Basics

### What is Zombicide: Lost Zombivors?

Zombicide: Lost Zombivors is a cooperative board game where players take on the roles of survivors in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by zombies. Your mission? To complete objectives, survive the zombie onslaught, and maybe even have a few laughs along the way.

### Components

The game comes with beautifully designed miniatures, including the survivors (aka Zombivors) and various types of zombies. The game board features detailed maps of different locations, such as abandoned buildings, streets, and the occasional creepy alleyway. Additionally, there are various cards, tokens, and dice to enhance the gameplay experience.

## Gameplay

### Setting Up

Setting up Zombicide: Lost Zombivors is like preparing for a zombie-themed party. Lay out the game board, distribute the miniatures and cards, and get ready to dive into the chaos. Just remember to keep the snacks away from the zombies – they have a tendency to be messy eaters.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players can perform actions such as moving, attacking zombies, searching for items, and using special abilities. The game is driven by strategic decisions and teamwork, making every turn a chance to outsmart the undead.

### Zombie Phases

After the players have taken their actions, it's the zombies' turn. They move, attack, and generally make life difficult for the survivors. The zombie phase adds a layer of tension and excitement to the game, keeping players on their toes.

### Winning and Losing

To win the game, players must complete all objectives before the zombie hordes overwhelm them. If all the survivors are killed or the zombies become too powerful, it's game over. Time to re-roll those characters and start again – hopefully with fewer bites this time.

## The Humor Factor

One of the best aspects of Zombicide: Lost Zombivors is the humor built into the gameplay. From the ridiculous event cards to the over-the-top zombie abilities, there's never a dull moment. The game embraces the absurdity of a zombie apocalypse, and you'll find yourself laughing as much as strategizing.

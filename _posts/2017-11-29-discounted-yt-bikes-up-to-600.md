[YT](https://www.yt-industries.com/en/) one of the most modern and desired direct sales bike companies is still keeping their Black Friday sales with discounts up to 600€ in their most expensive models.

Top specced carbon [Jeffsy](/2016/05/yt-jeffsy-review-pros-y-contras-deberia-comprarla.html) and Capra for less than 4.000€, which is a bargain considering the prices of other brands. Even Canyon can't compete with this. Also, for the budget ones, the AL versions of the Jeffsy or Capra cost 2.000€, which is a pretty good deal.

Their downhill bike, the Tues ranges from 4400€ to 2100€. Also, their dirt bikes are discounted but already sold out, so check it soon. Also worth checking the [outlet store](https://www.yt-industries.com/en/products/bike-outlet/) with bikes from last year on even extra discounts.

Remember that YT now also delivers to the US with [even bigger discounts there](https://www.yt-industries.com/en/shipping), considering the price differences. Delivery costs starting from 20€, check it before buying [here](https://www.yt-industries.com/en/shipping).

YT, which sponsors Aaron Gwin, Andreu Lacondeguy, and Cam Zink, is one of the most aggressive and cool brands in biking right now.

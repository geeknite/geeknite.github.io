## First Impressions

Let's start with the basics. This workstation is massive. It's designed to comfortably accommodate ten people, making it perfect for a busy office or a gathering of your local D&D group. The oak finish is sleek and stylish, giving off a "I mean serious business" vibe. But does it hold up under closer inspection? Let's find out.

## Design and Build Quality

The workstation boasts a sturdy construction, made from high-quality oak and black accents. It's built like a tank, which is great if you want your furniture to survive the apocalypse. The dimensions are 9000mm x 1530mm x 1200mm, which essentially means it's bigger than your hopes and dreams.

### Pros

- **Sturdy Construction**: This thing is solid. You could probably host sumo wrestling matches on it.
- **Spacious**: Plenty of room for all your monitors, keyboards, action figures, and twelve cups of coffee.
- **Stylish Finish**: The oak and black combo looks like it belongs in a swanky CEO office.

### Cons

- **Size**: Not ideal for small spaces. You might need to knock down a wall or two to fit it in your room.
- **Weight**: It's heavy. Make sure you have a few strong friends or a forklift handy.

## Functionality

### Workspace

With ten workstations, you can host a LAN party without anyone feeling cramped. The screens provide a bit of privacy, perfect for when you need to rage quit without your coworkers judging you.

### Cable Management

The designers behind this behemoth have thought about cable management. There are built-in channels to keep your cables neat and tidy. No more tripping over cords or having your cat chew through them.

### Comfort

While the workstation itself is solid, comfort depends on the chairs you pair it with. Invest in quality chairs; your back will thank you. And maybe your boss will too when productivity increases because people aren't constantly shifting and groaning.

## Real-World Usage

I tested this workstation in a real office environment. Here's what I found:

### Setup

The setup process was straightforward, though it required a team effort due to the size and weight of the components. Once assembled, it was clear that this workstation was built to last. My coworkers appreciated the ample space and sturdy build.

### Daily Use

The screens provided the perfect level of privacy, allowing for focused work without feeling isolated. Cable management channels kept the workspace clean and organized, reducing clutter and enhancing productivity.

### Durability

After several weeks of use, the workstation showed no signs of wear. It's clear that the materials used are top-notch, ensuring that this piece of furniture will stand the test of time.

## Comparison with Other Workstations

### IKEA Bekant

The **IKEA Bekant** workstation is a popular choice for many offices. It offers a sleek design and is more budget-friendly. However, it doesn't provide the same level of sturdiness or spaciousness as the Eternal workstation. If you're looking for something that can handle heavy equipment and provide ample space, the Eternal workstation is the way to go.

### Herman Miller Tables

**Herman Miller** is known for its high-quality office furniture. Their tables are elegant and built to last. However, they come with a hefty price tag, and their workstations typically accommodate fewer people. The Eternal workstation offers more space and functionality at a competitive price.

## Final Recommendation

If you need a workstation that can handle a bustling office or a dedicated gaming setup, the **Eternal 10 Person 2 Workstation** is a fantastic choice. It's sturdy, spacious, and stylish. Just make sure you have the room to fit it and the muscle to move it.

## What is Nemesis: Lockdown?

Nemesis: Lockdown is a standalone expansion to the hit game Nemesis. It transports players to a Martian base where you must complete objectives while fending off nightmarish aliens. Unlike your average board game night, this one might involve a lot of yelling, blaming, and betrayal. Fun, right?

### Components

The game comes with a plethora of beautifully designed miniatures, including terrifying alien creatures and detailed characters. The artwork and quality of the components are top-notch, making the game visually stunning and immersive.

### Setup Time

Setting up Nemesis: Lockdown is a bit like preparing for an interstellar mission. It takes time, patience, and possibly a coffee break. But trust me, once everything's laid out and ready, the real fun begins.

## Gameplay

### Turn Structure

Each turn in Nemesis: Lockdown consists of several phases:

1. **Event Phase**: Draw event cards that introduce new challenges or spawn more aliens. (Yay!)
2. **Action Phase**: Players perform actions like moving, attacking, and using items. Teamwork is key—or at least pretending to be a team until betrayal time.
3. **Intruder Phase**: Aliens move and attack. Brace yourself.

### Objectives and Strategy

Players must complete personal and global objectives to win the game. Whether it's fixing the power generator or sending a distress signal, each task is fraught with danger. Strategic planning and cooperation are crucial, but never forget to watch your back!

### Betrayal Mechanic

One of the standout features of Nemesis: Lockdown is the potential for betrayal. Some objectives might require you to sabotage your friends, leading to intense and hilarious moments of treachery. It's like _Among Us_, but with aliens and a lot more shouting.

## Pros and Cons

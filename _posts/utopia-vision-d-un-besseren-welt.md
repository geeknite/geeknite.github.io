## Comparison with Other Art Prints

### [Starry Night]({{ site.constants.wsib }}starry-night)

While **Starry Night** by Van Gogh is a classic, it doesn't offer the same futuristic and hopeful vision as Utopia. Both are stunning in their own right, but Utopia feels like a journey forward, while Starry Night is more reflective.

### [Mona Lisa]({{ site.constants.wsib }}mona-lisa)

**Mona Lisa** has her mysterious smile, but she doesn't come with a built-in narrative of a better world. Utopia's art print tells a story beyond the canvas, making it ideal for those who love speculative fiction and imaginative worlds.

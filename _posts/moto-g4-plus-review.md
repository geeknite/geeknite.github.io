**Welcome back, Geeknite readers!** Today, we’re traveling back in time to review a classic, the **Moto G4 Plus**. This phone has been around for a while, but is it still worth considering in 2025? Grab your flux capacitors; it’s time to find out!

## **Design and Build Quality**

The Moto G4 Plus is like that comfortable pair of jeans you just can't throw away. It sports a plastic body with a slight curve on the back, making it comfortable to hold. It's available in black and white, which is a bit like choosing between Darth Vader and a Stormtrooper—both cool, but do you really have a choice?

## **Display**

The G4 Plus has a 5.5-inch Full HD display with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels. The colors are vibrant, and the blacks are deep enough to hide your dark secrets. It’s not a Super AMOLED or anything fancy, but it gets the job done. Scrolling through your ex’s Instagram has never looked sharper.

## **Performance**

Under the hood, the G4 Plus is powered by the Snapdragon 617 processor, coupled with up to 4GB of RAM. In 2025, this might feel like you're driving an old Toyota Corolla in a world of Teslas. Multitasking is doable, but don’t expect it to run the latest games without turning into a potato.

## **Camera**

The camera setup on the Moto G4 Plus includes a 16MP rear sensor and a 5MP front shooter. Daylight photos are decent, but night shots might look like you're taking pictures through a potato. Selfies are acceptable, but maybe don't rely on it for your next Tinder profile picture.

## **Battery Life**

One of the Moto G4 Plus's strengths is its battery life. The 3000mAh battery can last a day with moderate use. However, with the fast-paced life of 2025 and the constant bombardment of notifications, it might struggle to keep up. Thankfully, it supports rapid charging, so you won’t be tethered to a wall socket for long.

## **Software**

The G4 Plus originally ran Android 6.0 Marshmallow, but has received updates up to Android 8.1 Oreo. In a world of Android 12 and MIUI, it feels a bit like using Windows XP when everyone else is on Windows 11. If you can overlook the outdated software, it’s still functional.

## **Price and Availability**

Originally priced at around $200, you can now find the Moto G4 Plus for dirt cheap on [eBay and Amazon]({{ site.constants.wsib }}moto-g4-plus). It’s almost like buying a vintage collectable—cool to have but maybe not for daily use.

## **Conclusion**

The Moto G4 Plus is a nostalgic trip down memory lane. It has a comfortable design, decent display, and reliable battery life. However, its performance and software are outdated, making it hard to recommend as a daily driver in 2025. It’s like buying a vintage car—it’s cool, but are you really going to drive it?

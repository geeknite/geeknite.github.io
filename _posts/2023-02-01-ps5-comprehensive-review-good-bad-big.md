The [PS5]({{ site.constants.wsib }}ps5) is the latest and greatest gaming console from Sony, and it's been making waves in the gaming world since its release. With its powerful hardware, lightning-fast load times, and beautiful graphics, it's easy to see why so many people are excited about the [PS5]({{ site.constants.wsib }}ps5). But let's be real, the [PS5]({{ site.constants.wsib }}ps5) is not without its flaws. Some years ago we compared the [PS4 with the Xbox One]({%- post_url 2013-07-15-ps4-vs-xbox-one-resumen-comparativa-definitiva-sorteo -%}) but now it's time for its successor.

First of all, let's talk about the size. The [PS5]({{ site.constants.wsib }}ps5) is big. Like, really big. It's so big that you might need to call in an interior designer just to figure out where to put it in your living room. And it's heavy too, so don't even think about trying to pick it up with one hand. It's like trying to lift a sumo wrestler after a big meal.

Next up, let's talk about the DualSense controller. On the one hand, it's a great feature, offering haptic feedback and adaptive triggers that make the gaming experience more immersive. On the other hand, the haptic feedback can be a little over-the-top, making even the simplest of actions feel like you're experiencing an earthquake. And the adaptive triggers? They might make your thumbs tired. [Remember that we also loved the Xbox controller]({%- post_url 2014-05-24-best-controller-pc-xbox-360 -%}).

The [PS5]({{ site.constants.wsib }}ps5) is also quite expensive, with a price tag that makes it one of the most expensive gaming consoles on the market. And even with its high price, it's still in short supply, making it difficult for people to get their hands on one. This has led to scalping and reselling, which has only made the situation worse. It's like trying to buy a ticket to a Taylor Swift concert, but with less screaming and more grumpy gamers.

And then there are the exclusive games. Some are truly stunning, offering incredible graphics and gameplay, but others are a little underwhelming, especially given the high price of the console. It's like ordering a fancy meal at a restaurant and getting a side salad instead.

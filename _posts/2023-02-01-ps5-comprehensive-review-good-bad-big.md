The [PS5]({{ site.constants.wsib }}ps5) is the latest and greatest gaming console from Sony, and it's been making waves in the gaming world since its release. With its powerful hardware, lightning-fast load times, and beautiful graphics, it's easy to see why so many people are excited about the [PS5]({{ site.constants.wsib }}ps5). But let's be real, the [PS5]({{ site.constants.wsib }}ps5) is not without its flaws. Some years ago we compared the [PS4 with the Xbox One]({%- post_url 2013-07-15-ps4-vs-xbox-one-resumen-comparativa-definitiva-sorteo -%}) but now it's time for its successor.

## The Good

### Performance

The PS5 boasts a custom AMD RDNA 2 GPU and Zen 2 CPU, making it a beast in terms of performance. Whether you're playing AAA titles or indie gems, the PS5 handles them with ease.

### DualSense Controller

The DualSense controller is a game-changer. With haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, it offers an immersive experience that's hard to beat.

### Exclusive Titles

Games like *Demon's Souls* and *Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart* showcase the PS5's capabilities beautifully.

## The Bad

### Size

The PS5 is huge. It's so big that you might need a separate room just for it. It's like trying to fit an elephant into a Smart car.

### Price

The PS5 is one of the most expensive consoles on the market. And with the ongoing scarcity, it's often resold at astronomically high prices.

### Supply Issues

Getting your hands on a PS5 feels like winning the lottery. The demand far outweighs the supply, leading to scalping and reselling at insane prices.

## The Ugly

### The Bulky

Seriously, this console is massive. If you're planning to buy one, make sure you have enough space. It's like bringing home a new pet - a very large, electronic pet.

## Gaming Experience

### Ray Tracing and HDR

Ray tracing technology brings a new level of realism to games, with dynamic lighting and reflections that make environments come to life. Coupled with HDR support, colors are more vibrant and contrasts are sharper, making every scene visually breathtaking.

### 8K Resolution

For those with 8K TVs, the PS5 offers support for 8K resolution, delivering an unprecedented level of detail and clarity. Even on 4K displays, games look sharper and more detailed thanks to supersampling techniques.

## Game Library and Compatibility

The PS5 is compatible with the vast majority of PS4 and PS5 games, ensuring that your existing library is playable on the new console. Many games receive performance and visual enhancements when played on the PS5, making them look and run better than ever before.

### Exclusive Titles

Sony continues to deliver a strong lineup of exclusive titles for the PlayStation platform. Some of the most anticipated games for the PS5 include:

- **Horizon Forbidden West**: Experience Aloy's journey with enhanced graphics and performance improvements.
- **God of War: Ragnarok**: Witness the epic conclusion to Kratos' Norse saga with stunning visuals and smooth gameplay.
- **Gran Turismo 7**: Race with unparalleled realism and detail in this latest installment of the renowned racing series.

## Final Thoughts

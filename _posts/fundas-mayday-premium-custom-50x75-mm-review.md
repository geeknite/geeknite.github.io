**Greetings, Geeknite readers!** Today, we're diving into the world of card protection with a review of the infamous Fundas Mayday Premium Custom 50x75 mm. If you've ever faced the dilemma of sleeving your cards, you're in the right place. So, buckle up, because we're about to embark on a sleeving adventure!

## **Why Sleeve Your Cards?**

Before we get to the juicy details of the Mayday Premium Custom Sleeves, let's address the elephant in the room: Why bother sleeving your cards at all?

### *Pros of Sleeving Your Games*

1. **Protection from Spills**: Sleeves act like a force field against rogue coffee spills, errant soda splashes, and any other liquid disasters waiting to ruin your game night.
2. **Increased Durability**: Sleeved cards can withstand the wear and tear of shuffling, dealing, and those overly enthusiastic players who treat cards like they're invincible.
3. **Eternal Youth**: Sleeves preserve the pristine condition of your cards, keeping them forever young and ready to charm new players for generations to come.
4. **Premium Pizzazz**: Premium sleeves give your games a touch of class, making you feel like a high roller in the world of board gaming.
5. **Cheap Therapy**: Sleeving your cards can be oddly therapeutic, allowing you to unwind and enter a state of gaming serenity.

### *Cons of Sleeving Your Games*

1. **Cardzilla!**: Sleeved cards might transform into oversized monsters that no longer fit into the game's original box or insert.
2. **Bank Breaker**: Premium sleeves come at a cost – your hard-earned cash! Before you know it, you've spent more on sleeves than the games themselves.
3. **Snug Life**: Snugging your most played games might result in a mix of sleeve-clad and sleeveless games, like a half-dressed board game party.
4. **Card Stuck-o-phobia**: Shuffling sleeved cards for the first time can be a clumsy experience, launching cards across the room.
5. **The Great Divider**: Not all board game communities embrace sleeving, with some players arguing that the tactile feel of unsleeved cards is part of the gaming experience.

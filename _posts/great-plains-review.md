Get ready for an epic journey through the whimsical world of Great Plains, where the stakes are high, and the cows are even higher.

## The Game Setup

Imagine yourself as a humble farmer in the Great Plains, but with a twist.

What's a farming game without some sabotage? Great Plains introduces hilarious sabotage cards that let players wreak havoc on each other's farms.

## Comparison with Other Farming Board Games

### [Agricola]({{ site.constants.wsib }}agricola)

Agricola is a classic farming strategy game that focuses more on resource management and less on humor. While Agricola is serious and complex, Great Plains offers a lighter and more whimsical approach.

### [Terraforming Mars]({%- post_url 2023-06-01-terraforming-mars-review -%})

Terraforming Mars is another strategy-heavy game, but it takes place on Mars instead of the Great Plains. Both games require careful planning and resource management, but Great Plains adds a humorous twist.

### [Catan]({{ site.constants.wsib }}catan)

Catan is known for its resource trading and settlement building. Great Plains shares some similarities but stands out with its unique farming theme and sabotage mechanics.

## Final Thoughts

**Great Plains** is a must-play for anyone who enjoys strategy games with a side of humor. Its innovative gameplay and quirky elements make it a standout title in the world of board games.

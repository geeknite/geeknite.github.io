## Introduction

Gather 'round, fellow Warhammer enthusiasts! Today, we're diving into the bone-chilling world of **Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Ossiarch Bonereapers Bone-tithe Nexus**. If you've ever wondered what it's like to demand bones from your enemies (and not in a creepy way), this game is your answer. Prepare to enter a realm where bones are currency, and your foes are just walking ATMs waiting to be cashed in.

## The Basics

### What is Bone-tithe Nexus?

Bone-tithe Nexus is a terrain feature for the Ossiarch Bonereapers faction in **Warhammer Age of Sigmar**. It revolves around the concept of the bone-tithe, a grim tax imposed by the Bonereapers on the unfortunate souls of the Mortal Realms. Essentially, you collect bones from your enemies and use them to power your faction's abilities. Who knew that skeletons could be such accountants?

### Components

The Bone-tithe Nexus kit comes with:
- **Terrain Piece**: A detailed and ominous structure that looks like it was designed by an osteologist with a flair for the dramatic.
- **Bone-tithe Tokens**: These tokens represent the bones you collect. Think of them as your game's version of frequent flyer miles, but with more necromancy.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up the Bone-tithe Nexus is a breeze. Place the terrain feature in your deployment zone, mark it with bone-tithe tokens, and you're ready to start collecting bones like a ghoul on Halloween.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, you command your Ossiarch Bonereapers to engage in combat and collect bones from fallen enemies. The more bones you gather, the more powerful abilities you can unlock. It's like a macabre version of collecting points in a video game, but with real consequences for your opponents.

### Combat

Combat is where the Bone-tithe Nexus shines. As your Bonereapers collect bones, you can use them to activate special abilities and buffs. It's not just about defeating your enemies; it's about profiting from their demise. Remember, in the world of the Bonereapers, every bone counts.

## The Fun Factor

### Tactical Depth

Bone-tithe Nexus adds a layer of strategic depth to your games. Deciding when to collect bones and how to spend them is crucial. Do you save them for a powerful late-game ability, or use them early to gain an immediate advantage? The choice is yours, but choose wisely – bones are a finite resource.

### Humor and Theme

Despite its grim theme, Bone-tithe Nexus has a humorous undertone. The idea of demanding bones as tax is both sinister and absurd, making the game enjoyable even as you plot your opponent's downfall. It's like playing as the IRS, but with more skeletons and less paperwork.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- **Strategic Depth**: The bone-tithe mechanic adds a unique layer of strategy to the game.
- **High-Quality Components**: The terrain piece and tokens are beautifully designed and add to the game's immersive experience.
- **Replayability**: With different strategies and abilities to explore, each game feels fresh and exciting.

### Cons

- **Complex Setup**: While the terrain piece is easy to place, managing bone-tithe tokens and abilities can be overwhelming for newcomers.
- **Theme Sensitivity**: The macabre theme might not be everyone's cup of tea. If you're not a fan of skeletons and necromancy, this might not be the game for you.
- **Expensive**: Like many Warhammer products, the Bone-tithe Nexus kit can be pricey. Prepare your wallet for a bone-tithe of its own.

## Final Thoughts

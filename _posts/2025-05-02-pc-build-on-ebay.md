## Why eBay?

You might be wondering, why build a PC using eBay? Here's why:

1. **Competitive Prices**: eBay often has deals that are harder to find elsewhere. Plus, with bidding options, you might score an even better deal (if you're lucky and don't get outbid by a mysterious stranger).
2. **Seller Ratings**: eBay's rating system ensures that you can buy from trusted sellers. Check their feedback before making a purchase. If it looks shady, run faster than Sonic the Hedgehog.
3. **Global Availability**: Can't find a particular component in your country? eBay's global marketplace has got you covered.

**Pro Tip**: Always double-check shipping costs and estimated delivery times. You don't want to wait three months for your shiny new gadget to arrive or pay a shipping fee that rivals the price of the item itself.

## Tips for Buying on eBay

Here are some pro tips to make your eBay shopping experience smooth and enjoyable:

1. **Check the Seller's Feedback**: Always buy from sellers with high ratings and positive feedback. Look for those with at least 95% positive reviews. If the seller has more negative reviews than a movie flop, steer clear.
2. **Read the Description Carefully**: Make sure you know what you're buying. Check for any mention of defects or issues. If the description sounds like it's written by a cryptic poet, you might want to reconsider.
3. **Compare Prices**: Don't jump on the first listing you see. Compare prices from different sellers to ensure you're getting the best deal. Remember, patience is a virtue, especially when it saves you money.
4. **Use eBay's Buyer Protection**: If something goes wrong with your purchase, eBay's Buyer Protection program can help you get your money back. It's like a safety net for your wallet.

**Bonus Tip**: If you're bidding, set a maximum price and stick to it. Don't let the thrill of the auction drain your bank account or turn you into a compulsive bidder.

## Choosing Your Components

Now that you're equipped with essential eBay tips, let's dive into the fun part – choosing your components!

### CPU: The Brain of Your PC

The CPU is like the brain of your PC, so you want it to be smart but not too expensive. I recommend the **AMD Ryzen 5 3600**. It's a six-core marvel that packs a punch without breaking the bank. Look for listings with good feedback and competitive prices.

### GPU: The Graphics Powerhouse

Next up, the GPU. If you're a gamer or into graphic design, you'll need a powerful GPU. The **NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Super** is a fantastic option. It won't cost you an arm and a leg, and it handles most games and tasks with ease.

### RAM: Memory That Matters

For RAM, aim for at least 16GB to ensure smooth multitasking. Consider the **Corsair Vengeance LPX** series. It's reliable, speedy, and reasonably priced.

### Storage: Speed and Capacity

Opt for an SSD for your primary storage. The **Samsung 970 EVO** is a top choice, offering fast read/write speeds. Pair it with a larger HDD for additional storage space.

### Motherboard: The Backbone

Choose a motherboard that supports your CPU and GPU. The **MSI B450 Tomahawk** is a solid option with excellent build quality and features.

### Case: The Enclosure

Select a case that suits your style and allows for good airflow. The **NZXT H510** is sleek, spacious, and affordable.

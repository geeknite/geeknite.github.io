## What is Atmar's Cardography: NPC Heroes & Villains?

Atmar's Cardography is a collection of ready-made NPCs (Non-Player Characters) for your tabletop RPG campaigns. Whether you need a valiant hero to aid your party or a dastardly villain to thwart their plans, this book has you covered. With detailed backstories, unique abilities, and plenty of personality, these NPCs are sure to add depth and excitement to your games.

### The Basics

In Atmar's Cardography: NPC Heroes & Villains, each character is presented with a full-page illustration, a detailed backstory, and a list of special abilities. The book is divided into two sections: Heroes and Villains, making it easy to find the perfect character for any situation.

### Components

The book features:

- **Artwork**: Stunning illustrations that bring each character to life. You might find yourself wondering if these NPCs are actually cooler than your own characters.
- **Backstories**: Detailed histories that provide context and motivation for each character. Perfect for those moments when your players ask, "Why is this NPC helping us?" or "Why does this villain hate us so much?"
- **Abilities**: Unique powers and skills that set each character apart. From magical spells to combat prowess, these abilities will keep your players on their toes.

**Pro Tip**: Don't let your players see the villain section. There's nothing worse than a spoiled surprise when they recognize the big bad from a random flip through the book.

## Introduction

Hello, brave warriors of Middle-earth! Today, we embark on a journey through the epic and strategic world of **Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game: Gondor at War**. If you've ever dreamed of leading the armies of Gondor while wearing a bathrobe and pretending it's a regal cloak, this game is for you. Prepare for battles, laughter, and perhaps a few moments of yelling at dice.

## The Basics

### What is Gondor at War?

Gondor at War is an expansion for the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game, where players recreate the legendary battles of Gondor against the forces of Mordor. With detailed miniatures, immersive scenarios, and tactical gameplay, this expansion promises hours of strategic fun.

### Components

The game includes beautifully crafted miniatures representing heroes, warriors, and beasts from the epic saga. From the majestic Knights of Dol Amroth to the terrifying Black Riders, each miniature is a work of art. Also included are scenario booklets, tokens, and a plethora of dice.

**Pro Tip**: Try not to lose the tiny Minas Tirith soldiers. They have a tendency to disappear into the carpet, only to reappear when you least expect it.

## Gameplay

### Setting Up

Setting up Gondor at War is like preparing for an actual battle. It requires strategic placement of miniatures, reading through scenario booklets, and perhaps a motivational speech to your troops (aka your friends). Layout the terrain, position your forces, and get ready to dive into the action.

### Turn Phases

Each turn consists of several phases:

1. **Priority Phase**: Determine who goes first by rolling dice. May the odds be ever in your favor!
2. **Move Phase**: Maneuver your troops strategically across the battlefield. This is where your bathrobe-cloak flapping in the wind really adds to the drama.
3. **Shoot Phase**: Engage in long-range combat with archers and siege weapons. Hope your dice rolls are better than your last attempt to make a trick shot with a paper ball.
4. **Fight Phase**: Engage in close combat. Watch as your miniatures clash in epic duels and cry out in joy or agony depending on the dice rolls.

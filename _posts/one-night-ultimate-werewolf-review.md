## Introduction

Greetings, fellow gamers! Ever wanted to know what it feels like to be a villager, a seer, or even a werewolf during the medieval ages? Well, look no further because **One Night Ultimate Werewolf** is here to transform your game night into a suspense-filled, joyride of accusations, lies, and revelations. Get ready for a game that promises fun, tension, and a lot of laughter.

## What is One Night Ultimate Werewolf?

One Night Ultimate Werewolf is a fast-paced party game for 3-10 players. The game focuses on social deduction, where players take on different roles, trying to identify who the werewolves are before it's too late. The twist? You only have one night to figure it out!

### The Basics

In One Night Ultimate Werewolf, players are assigned roles at the beginning of the game, such as villagers, seers, robbers, and of course, werewolves. Each role has unique abilities that can be used to gather information or confuse the other players. The game starts with a night phase where players perform their actions, followed by a day phase where discussions and accusations fly.

### Components

The game comes with:
- **Role Cards**: Each player gets a role card that determines their abilities and objectives.
- **Tokens**: Tokens help keep track of player roles and actions.
- **App**: One Night Ultimate Werewolf has a companion app that guides players through the night phase, making the game quick and easy to set up.

**Pro Tip**: Use the app's voiceover for added drama and suspense. It's worth it.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up One Night Ultimate Werewolf is as quick as a werewolf's bite. Distribute role cards, place tokens, and start the app. The app will guide you through the night phase, ensuring everyone performs their actions correctly.

### Turns and Actions

During the night phase, players perform their roles' actions in secret. The seer might look at another player's card, the thief might swap roles with another player, and the werewolves will find out who their fellow werewolves are. After the night phase, players wake up and discuss what they've learned to identify the werewolves.

### Discussion and Accusations

The heart of One Night Ultimate Werewolf lies in the day phase, where players discuss, accuse, and try to figure out who the werewolves are. You might find yourself lying through your teeth, or convincing others of your innocence. The key is to stay calm and collected, and maybe throw in a few red herrings for good measure.

## The Howling Fun

### Roles and Strategies

Part of the fun of One Night Ultimate Werewolf is the diverse range of roles and strategies. From the sneaky thief to the all-seeing seer, each role brings its own flavor to the game. The werewolves will try to blend in, while the villagers will use their abilities to uncover the truth.

**Funny Moment**: During one game, our seer declared confidently that they had seen two werewolves, only to realize they had been swapped by the thief. The ensuing confusion was priceless.

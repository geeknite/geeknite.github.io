## The Shire: A Green Wonderland

The Shire, home to the hobbits, is a lush, green paradise. The rolling hills, fertile farmlands, and cozy hobbit holes are all painted in various shades of green. The pigments used by the hobbits are derived from their natural surroundings, such as lush grass, leaves, and even the occasional mossy stone. The greens of the Shire symbolize growth, harmony, and the simple joys of life.

## Rivendell: Elven Elegance

Rivendell, the hidden valley of the Elves, is a place of ethereal beauty. The pigments here are a mix of delicate pastels and shimmering metallics. The Elves use natural minerals and precious metals to create their paints, resulting in colors that seem to glow with an inner light. The blues, silvers, and whites of Rivendell reflect the Elves' connection to nature, magic, and wisdom.

Gold, amber, and warm earth tones dominate the color palette, creating a sense of timeless beauty and tranquility.

Rohan, the land of the horse-lords, is characterized by vast fields of golden wheat and sun-kissed plains. The pigments here are warm and earthy, reflecting the rugged beauty and strength of the Rohirrim. Yellow, brown, and rich red tones are commonly used in Rohan's art and decoration. These pigments are often made from crushed stones, clay, and even horsehair.

The pigments here are dark and foreboding, with blacks, grays, and fiery reds dominating the color scheme.

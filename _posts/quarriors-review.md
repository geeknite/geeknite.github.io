## Introduction

Hello, fellow dice enthusiasts! Today, we’re diving into the magical world of **Quarriors! Dice-Building Game**. If you’ve ever dreamt of collecting mystical creatures and casting powerful spells using dice, then this game is for you. It’s a unique blend of strategy, luck, and more dice than you can shake a wizard’s staff at.

## What is Quarriors?

Quarriors is a fast-paced, dice-building game where players take on the roles of Quarriors (warriors with questionable fashion choices) competing to summon creatures and cast spells using their dice collections. The objective is simple: score glory points and become the most powerful Quarrior in the land.

### Components

The game comes with:
- **Dice**: Lots of them. In fact, it's like a dice explosion happened in the box. There are creature dice, spell dice, and basic dice in various colors and designs.
- **Cards**: Each creature and spell is represented by a card that outlines its abilities and glory points.
- **Dice Bag**: A stylish bag to hold all your dice. Whether you use it as a fashion accessory is up to you.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up Quarriors is like preparing for a magical ritual. Lay out the creature and spell cards, grab your dice bag, and get ready to roll. Each player starts with a selection of basic dice in their bag, and the aim is to use these dice to acquire more powerful ones from the wilds (the central play area).

### Turns and Actions

Each turn follows these phases:
- **Roll Phase**: Draw six dice from your bag and roll them. Prepare to curse the dice gods if you roll poorly.
- **Capture Phase**: Use the Quiddity (currency) rolled to capture creatures and spells from the wilds.
- **Deploy Phase**: Summon creatures and cast spells to score glory points and disrupt your opponents.
- **Score Phase**: Score glory points for creatures that survive until your next turn. Laugh maniacally if all your creatures remain unscathed.

### Strategy

The strategy in Quarriors revolves around building a powerful dice pool and making tactical decisions about which creatures and spells to deploy. It's a delicate balance between offense and defense, requiring both luck and cunning.

## The Experience

### Tension and Excitement

The game creates a thrilling atmosphere with each roll of the dice. The suspense of drawing and rolling dice, combined with the strategic deployment of creatures, ensures an engaging experience.

### Funny Mishaps

Despite the serious fantasy theme, Quarriors offers plenty of opportunities for humor. Whether it’s summoning a creature only to have it defeated immediately, or rolling nothing but Quiddity while your opponents roll epic creatures, these moments often result in laughter and memorable stories. Who knew that magic battles could be this entertaining?

### Replayability

With various creatures and spells to choose from, no two games of Quarriors are ever the same. This ensures high replayability as players can experiment with different strategies and combinations.

## Design and Build Quality

The GoPro Hero4 Black looks like it means business, with its rugged and compact design. It's as if it was sculpted by action camera gods who decided that they needed to make something that could survive a fall off Mount Everest – or at least your kitchen counter.

### Key Features

1. **Ultra HD 4K Video**: The GoPro Hero4 Black offers 4K video at 30 frames per second. It's like having a miniature Hollywood studio in your pocket.
2. **12MP Photos**: Capture stunning 12MP photos that will make your Instagram followers green with envy.
3. **Advanced Image Stabilization**: Because nobody wants shaky footage of their epic bike ride, right?
4. **Waterproof up to 40m**: Perfect for your underwater adventures, or just filming your kid's pool party.
5. **Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Connectivity**: Share your daring escapades instantly with the world.

## Performance

When it comes to performance, the GoPro Hero4 Black doesn't disappoint. Its 4K video quality is jaw-dropping, and the advanced image stabilization ensures your footage is smooth, even if your ride is anything but. The 12MP photos are crisp and vibrant, capturing every detail of your adventures.

### Usability

Navigating the GoPro Hero4 Black is intuitive, thanks to its simple interface and responsive buttons. Sure, it might not have a touchscreen like its fancy successors, but who needs touchscreens when you've got rugged reliability?

## Battery Life

Let's talk battery life. The GoPro Hero4 Black's battery can last up to two hours when filming in 1080p, which is decent but not exceptional. If you're planning a full day of filming, we recommend carrying a couple of spare batteries. After all, nothing kills the mood faster than a 'low battery' warning.

## Comparisons

How does the GoPro Hero4 Black stack up against newer models?

### [GoPro Hero10 Black]({% post_url 2023-07-04-prime-day-bike-gadgets-accesories %})

The Hero10 Black offers 5.3K video and 23MP photos, along with advanced stabilization and a front-facing screen. It's the shiny new toy in the GoPro lineup, but it also comes with a hefty price tag.

### [DJI Osmo Action]({{ site.constants.wsib }}dji-osmo-action)

The Osmo Action offers 4K video and 12MP photos with a front-facing screen for easy framing. It's a strong competitor to the Hero4 Black, especially for vloggers.

## Final Thoughts

So, is the GoPro Hero4 Black still worth it in 2025? Absolutely! While it may not have all the bells and whistles of newer models, it offers solid performance, durability, and fantastic video quality at a fraction of the price. It's perfect for those who want to capture their adventures without breaking the bank.

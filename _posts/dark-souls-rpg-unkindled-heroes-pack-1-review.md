Greetings, brave souls! Today, we venture into the brutal and unforgiving world of **Dark Souls RPG: Unkindled Heroes Pack 1**.

## What's Included in the Pack?

The **Unkindled Heroes Pack 1** comes with new characters, miniatures, and equipment that will test your mettle. Here's a breakdown of what you'll find:

- **New Heroes**: The pack introduces new characters, each with unique abilities and backgrounds. Meet the Unkindled Ones who have risen from the ashes to challenge the darkness.

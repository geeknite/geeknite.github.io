We already talked a few years ago [how to prepare for Black Friday]({% post_url 2018-10-25-dont-get-scammed-black-friday-like-pro %}), but today in 2022 many things have changed and our ideas on shopping have changed as well.

During Black Friday, you don't have to go to an "official" store to buy the latest game or gadget. The internet has become a free store that allows you to purchase everything from the comfort of your home, wherever you are. Many stores are opting now for more days of offers, [amazon for example has around 10 days with offers](https://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&linkCode=ur2&linkId=E3JCOPRWJFHIP2PV&tag=%7B%7B%20site.constants%5B0%5D.amazon_com%20%7D%7D&linkId=Z6HW7WG5Z73QGVTE){: rel="nofollow"}, but many people expect for the big deals on Friday, which we will see if there are many or not.

This gives the opportunity to shop from the comfort of your home without rushes. You have the time to compare and check if the offers is good enough for you, or even find [the best deals on the internet]({{ site.constants[0].wsib }}).

Tips for Smart Shopping
-----------------------

Most of the tips that we gave 3 years ago are still vigent, specially:

- **Don't buy anything you won't use**, ponder it's use and consider it's cost. For example, consider how many hours will you use it, is it a good price per hour? This consideration will give some perspective and make you think if it's a compulsive buy or not. If you think you will regret that buy, don't do it.
- **Consider if you really need to be Prime**: If you are buying at Amazon, consider if you really need to be Prime. You can check out our article [Vale la pena ser Prime en Amazon en 2023]({%- post_url 2023-01-01-vale-la-pena-ser-prime-amazon-2023 -%}) to help you decide.

And remember, if even with these tips you feel that you need that special present for yourself, don't doubt it. If you don't take care of yourself, who will?

Have a nice week and don't go crazy shopping!

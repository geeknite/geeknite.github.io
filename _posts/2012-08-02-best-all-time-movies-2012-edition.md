[Vertigo]({{ site.constants.wsib }}/us/Vertigo) by Alfred Hitchcock has been named "**best all-time film**" beating [Citizen Kane]({{ site.constants.wsib }}/us/Citizen%20Kane) by Orson Welles, according to the latest survey by the magazine _Sight and Sound Festival of British Film_ (_BFI_). This specialized publication conducts such surveys every ten years and the film directed by Welles had occupied the top spot on the list of the top 50 films over the past five decades. In the last survey, the experts placed in first position **[Vertigo]({{ site.constants.wsib }}/us/Vertigo)** , the thriller directed by the British director in 1958, surpassing by 34 votes to **[Citizen Kane]({{ site.constants.wsib }}/us/Citizen%20Kane)** , and not included in the list any film shot in the last decade. Those experts in films, a total of 846 distributors, critics, academics and writers, were asked to rate the work according to their importance in film history, their findings aesthetic or the impact it had every film on a personal level in based on their own vision of cinema.  

With a cast that includes actors like James Stewart and Kim Novak, Vertigo is about a retired police officer, Scotty Ferguson, who is afraid of heights. In the latest survey the magazine conducted a decade ago, the Hitchcock movie, the British director himself referred to as his "most personal film," had been only five votes to [Citizen Kane]({{ site.constants.wsib }}/us/Citizen%20Kane) (1941). Of these two movies

I loved Vertigo and I love that it got the title of the best movie. As with Welles's film, Vertigo received mixed reviews when it opened but has gained prestige over time. In the classification of _BFI_, Yasujiro Ozu's film [Tokyo Story]({{ site.constants.wsib }}/us/Tokyo%20Story) (1953) went from fifth to third place, while [La Regie du Jeu]({{ site.constants.wsib }}/us/La%20Regie%20du%20Jeu) (1939) by Jean Renoir lost a position until the fourth.

Among the top ten films were two new entries: [Man With a Movie Camera]({{ site.constants.wsib }}/us/Man%20With%20a%20Movie%20Camera) (1929) by Dziga Vertov, at number eight, and [The Passion Of Joan Of Arc]({{ site.constants.wsib }}/us/The%20Passion%20Of%20Joan%20Of%20Arc) (1927) by Carl Theodor Dreyer, in ninth position. Is surprising how many movies of before the 30' are in the top ten, and not even one of beyond the 70'. Probably many of us have not seen many of these movies even many of us see a lot of movies, in my case at least one for very 3-4 days, but today's mindset probably is not prepared for this kind of old good movies, maybe all these critics are stuck in time. Of the selected works, the most recent was [2001: A Space Odyssey]({{ site.constants.wsib }}/us/2001%20A%20Space%20Odyssey) (1968) by Stanley Kubrick, in sixth place.

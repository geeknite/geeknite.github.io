## Introduction

Welcome, fellow card game enthusiasts! Are you ready to channel your inner rage and smash your way to victory? Well, you better be because we're about to dive into **AngerSmash**, the card game that has everyone talking (or yelling). This game combines strategy, chaos, and a whole lot of laughter. Think of it as a friendly brawl where everyone leaves with a smile… or a grudge. Let's get smashing!

## What is AngerSmash?

AngerSmash is a competitive card game designed for 2-6 players. The objective? Use your wits, strategy, and a bit of luck to outsmart your opponents and be the last one standing. Each player takes on a character with unique abilities, adding layers of strategy and unpredictability to each game.

### Components

The game comes with:
- **Character Cards**: Each with unique abilities and stats.
- **Action Cards**: Attack, defend, and special cards that add twists and turns.
- **Rage Tokens**: Because what's AngerSmash without some rage?
- **Board**: A beautifully designed board to track your progress and, of course, your rage levels.

**Fun Fact**: The game includes a special "Rage Quit" card. If used correctly, it can turn the tide of the game or backfire spectacularly. Use at your own risk!

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up AngerSmash is like preparing for a friendly skirmish. Lay out the board, distribute the character cards, and shuffle the action cards. Each player starts with a set number of rage tokens and a hand of action cards. Ready? Let's get smashing!

### Turn Phases

Each turn consists of several phases:
1. **Draw Phase**: Draw an action card.
2. **Action Phase**: Play an action card to attack, defend, or use special abilities.
3. **Rage Phase**: Gain or lose rage tokens based on the outcome of your actions.
4. **End Phase**: Check if any player has reached the ultimate rage level and triggered the "Rage Quit" condition.

### Winning and Losing

To win, you must be the last player standing or have the most rage tokens when the game ends. But beware, the "Rage Quit" card can change everything in an instant, making it anyone's game until the very end.

**Pro Tip**: Always keep an eye on your opponents' rage levels. A well-timed "Defuse" card can save you from a devastating "Rage Quit" attack.

## AngerSmash: The Humor Factor

One of the best aspects of AngerSmash is the humor woven into the gameplay. From the quirky character abilities to the hilarious action cards, there's never a dull moment. The game embraces the absurdity of rage-induced chaos, and you'll find yourself laughing as much as strategizing.

**Funny Moment**: During one game, our "Zen Master" character managed to stay calm and collected until the very end, only to lose in a spectacular rage explosion triggered by a misplayed "Calm Down" card. The irony was not lost on anyone!

## Introduction

Welcome, fellow chaos enthusiasts! Today, we're diving into the riotous world of **Exploding Kittens**, the card game that combines strategy, luck, and a healthy dose of insanity. If you love cats, explosions, and laughing until your sides hurt, then this game is your perfect match. Prepare for a wild ride filled with unexpected twists and outrageous fun.

## What is Exploding Kittens?

Exploding Kittens is a highly strategic, kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette. Players take turns drawing cards until someone draws an Exploding Kitten, which results in immediate and feline-induced death. To avoid exploding, players can use various cards in their hand to defuse the kitten, skip their turn, or even force another player to take two turns (because sharing is caring).

### The Basics

In Exploding Kittens, players draw cards one by one until someone draws an Exploding Kitten. The game continues until only one player remains, who is crowned the supreme non-exploded victor. The deck contains various cards that allow players to manipulate turns, peek at the deck, or relocate kittens.

### Components

The game comes with:
- **Cards**: 56 cards featuring hilarious and quirky illustrations by The Oatmeal.
- **Instructions**: A simple rule sheet to get you started quickly.
- **Box**: The box itself is a thing of beauty and humor.

**Pro Tip**: Don't let your cat near the cards. Those claws are the real supervillains.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up Exploding Kittens is quick and easy. Shuffle the deck, deal cards to each player, and place the Exploding Kittens back into the deck. Now you're ready to begin your chaotic journey.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players draw a card from the deck and hope it's not an Exploding Kitten. If it is, they must use a Defuse card or face instant, adorable death. The game includes various action cards that let players skip turns, peek at the deck, or shuffle it. Use these cards wisely to outmaneuver your opponents.

### Combat

Okay, it's not exactly combat, but the strategic use of action cards can feel like a battle of wits. Players must carefully decide when to use their cards to maximize their chances of survival. Did you plan an epic move just to have your opponent shuffle the deck? Welcome to Exploding Kittens, where plans often go hilariously awry.

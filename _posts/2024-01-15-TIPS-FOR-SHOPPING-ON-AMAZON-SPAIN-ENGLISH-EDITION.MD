For those who haven't been introduced to the world of [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&linkCode=ur2&linkId=E3JCOPRWJFHIP2PV&tag={{ site.constants.amazon_com }}&linkId=Z6HW7WG5Z73QGVTE){: rel="nofollow"}, it's basically the internet's giant shopping cart, originally from the US but with a local branch in Spain that's been around for a few years now. Known for its vast selection of books, Amazon now sells just about anything you can think of, often at prices that will make your wallet weep with joy. After years of online shopping, Amazon Spain has become my go-to store, offering top-notch customer service that has never let me down.

Here's a list of tips, sprinkled with humor, based on my shopping adventures on Amazon Spain over the years:

1. **The obvious choice for shopping from Spain is** [amazon.es](https://www.amazon.es/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=3626&creative=24822&linkCode=ur2&tag={{ site.constants.amazon_es }}){: rel="nofollow"} or its fashion outlet [BuyVip](https://www.amazon.es/b?ie=UTF8&node=13713654031&tag={{ site.constants.amazon_es }}){: rel="nofollow"}. They might not have as many sections or products as [amazon.co.uk](https://www.amazon.co.uk/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&linkCode=ur2&tag={{ site.constants.amazon_uk }}){: rel="nofollow"} or [amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&linkCode=ur2&tag={{ site.constants.amazon_com }}&linkId=E3JCOPRWJFHIP2PV){: rel="nofollow"}, but for electronics, gadgets, books, and clothes, it's a solid option. ~~Free shipping used to kick in at 19€ for books or clothes, otherwise, it was 2.99€ for the cheapest option~~. But now, in a thrilling twist, **free shipping is yours if you spend over 29€** unless you want it in one day, in which case you'll need to [become a Prime member](https://www.amazon.es/gp/prime/pipeline/landing/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0&linkCode=ll2&tag={{ site.constants.amazon_es }}&linkId=3d1d9f5bc192c963b2abefbca0dadbba){: rel="nofollow"}.

2. A great tool for quickly comparing prices across different Amazons is [Smartshopping #PYB]({{ site.constants.wsib }}?c=es), which saves time and also compares prices with [Ebay](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/1185-53479-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=1&pub=5575077854&toolid=10001&campid=5337456056&customid=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229501&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg){: rel="nofollow"}. It'll recommend the best online stores for your product and offer interesting alternatives.

3. One of my favorite options was shopping on [amazon.co.uk](https://www.amazon.co.uk/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&linkCode=ur2&tag={{ site.constants.amazon_uk }}){: rel="nofollow"}, where they had a bit of everything and free shipping to Spain for orders over 25 pounds. However, in a plot twist worthy of a telenovela, they stopped offering free shipping to Spain in June 2013. So, while they have a wide variety of products, **the shipping costs and currency exchange rates** mean you need to be cautious before clicking 'buy'. Still, it's a good option if you can't find what you're looking for on other European Amazons. Post-Brexit, the currency exchange rate has become more favorable, so you might want to [Take Advantage of Brexit as a Consumer]({%- post_url 2016-06-26-como-aprovechar-el-brexit-como-consumidores -%}).

4. If you're buying from outside the Eurozone, consider using the *Amazon Currency Converter* for a hassle-free exchange rate. And of course, **if you can, shop within the Eurozone**: [amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1638&creative=19454&linkCode=ur2&site-redirect=de&tag={{ site.constants.amazon_de }}){: rel="nofollow"}, [amazon.it](https://www.amazon.it/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=3370&creative=24114&linkCode=ur2&tag={{ site.constants.amazon_it }}){: rel="nofollow"}, [amazon.fr](https://www.amazon.fr/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1642&creative=19458&linkCode=ur2&tag={{ site.constants.amazon_fr }}), or [amazon.es](https://www.amazon.es/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=3626&creative=24822&linkCode=ur2&tag={{ site.constants.amazon_es }}){: rel="nofollow"}.

5. Be wary of shopping on [amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&linkCode=ur2&tag={{ site.constants.amazon_com }}&linkId=E3JCOPRWJFHIP2PV){: rel="nofollow"}, as your package will come from the USA and **customs could be an issue**. Although Amazon includes an extra fee for customs, the total cost can significantly increase, making European Amazons a preferable option.

6. **Try to buy products sold by Amazon itself**; third-party products are fine as long as Amazon handles the shipping, allowing you to combine shipping costs for different items. If buying from third parties, you'll likely face separate shipping fees for each product.

7. It's generally better to buy third-party products from your home country, in our case, [amazon.es](https://www.amazon.es/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=3626&creative=24822&linkCode=ur2&tag={{ site.constants.amazon_es }}){: rel="nofollow"}, to avoid future issues. Stick to single-product purchases and scrutinize the shipping fees.

8. Before making any purchase, compare prices across all European Amazons. A single Amazon account works for all countries, so add the product to your cart and proceed as if you're going to pay to see the final price with shipping. This way, you can compare the real cost.

Happy shopping, and may your carts be ever in your favor!

## Fundas Zacatrus Dixit Premium Review 2025

Ah, the joy of playing *Dixit*, where imagination runs wild and cards are as precious as a dragon’s hoard. But alas, with great power comes great responsibility—or in our case, the need for **card sleeves**. Today, we dive into the **Fundas Zacatrus Dixit Premium (80x120mm) (50)**. Spoiler alert: They’re more protective than a parent at a rock concert.

### First Impressions: The Unboxing

Opening the pack of Fundas Zacatrus Dixit Premium feels like uncovering a treasure chest. The sleeves are neat, smooth, and genuinely, they could double as a mirror for your card-loving soul.

### Size Matters

These sleeves are **80x120mm**, perfect for Dixit cards. If your cards could speak, they'd say, “Finally, a sleeve that fits like a glove!” No more awkward corners or slipping cards. It’s a snugger fit than your grandma’s knitted sweater.

### The Material: Durability Meets Elegance

Made from premium quality plastic, these sleeves are as durable as your uncle's old truck. They fend off scratches, spills, and even the wrath of an overly enthusiastic shuffler.

### The Test: A Battle of the Sleeves

We put these sleeves through rigorous testing—more intense than a game night marathon:

1. **Spill Test**: We poured soda (accidentally on purpose) over the sleeves. Result? Cards stayed dry as a desert.
2. **Scratch Test**: We dragged them across a table, and not a single scuff. They laughed in the face of danger.
3. **Shuffle Test**: Ah, the shuffling. They slid smoothly, making you feel like a card wizard.

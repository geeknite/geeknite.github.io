**Seriously, this thing is a nostalgia bomb**. From the clicky buttons to the retro design, it feels like a trip back to the '90s. If you grew up blowing on cartridges and arguing over who gets to play next, the RG351P will hit you right in the feels.

### Retroid Pocket 3

#### The Bad

1. **Battery Life**: The 4000mAh battery provides about 6 hours of gaming, which is decent but slightly less than the RG351P.

## Introduction

Forbidden Psalm (Mörk Borg): They Came from the Necropolis is an expansion that takes the already grim world of Mörk Borg to new depths of darkness—and humor.

## Gameplay

### Setting Up

Setting up Forbidden Psalm is like preparing for a haunted house visit—except this time, you’re the ghostbuster. The game includes new character sheets, mission cards, and a necropolis map that’s just begging to be explored. You’ll need your Mörk Borg core rules, but let’s be honest, if you’re here, you probably already have them memorized.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players choose actions from their character sheets, ranging from attacking undead horrors to solving cryptic puzzles. The mission cards dictate the objectives, which can involve anything from rescuing a wayward soul to battling a horde of skeletons. Remember, the necropolis doesn’t play fair— and neither should you.

### Combat

Combat in Forbidden Psalm is a blend of strategy, luck, and dark humor. Roll the dice, pray to whatever deity you believe in, and hope your character doesn’t lose a limb—or their sanity. The attack modifier deck adds unpredictability, and you might find yourself laughing maniacally or crying in frustration.

## The Story

### Campaign Mode

The campaign mode progresses through a series of missions, each more treacherous than the last. It’s like reading a horror novel, but you’re the protagonist—and the monsters are very real. Spoiler: Expect to die. A lot.

### Side Missions & Characters

Forbidden Psalm introduces new characters with unique abilities and side missions that add depth to the storyline. Level up, evolve, and maybe, just maybe, survive the necropolis. But don’t get too attached; retirement isn’t usually voluntary here.

Lighting is where the Dazor Magnifying Lamp truly shines (pun intended). It features LED lights that are both powerful and energy-efficient. You'll get a bright, even light that covers your entire workspace without causing eye strain—unless you decide to stare directly into the LEDs, in which case, we can't help you.

### **Adjustable Brightness**

The lamp comes with adjustable brightness settings, so you can customize the lighting to suit your needs. Whether you need a gentle glow for reading or a blinding light for detailed inspection, this lamp has got you covered. Just don't use it to interrogate your pets—they'll never forgive you.

### **The Lamp's Personality**

The lamp sometimes feels like it has a mind of its own. It might decide to droop slightly just when you're in the middle of a very delicate operation, or it might stand up straight and proud like it's posing for a portrait. It's like having a very well-behaved but slightly mischievous assistant.

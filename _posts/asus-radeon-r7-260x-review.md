### Productivity

For those who need their GPU for tasks beyond gaming, the R7 260X holds its own. Basic video editing, 3D modeling, and rendering tasks are well within its capabilities, although it's not the powerhouse you'd want for professional workloads. Think of it as the reliable bike you ride to work, not the Ferrari you flaunt at the car show.

## Power Consumption and Cooling

With a TDP of 115W, the R7 260X is relatively power-efficient compared to higher-end GPUs. However, it does require a decent cooling solution to keep temperatures in check, especially if you're pushing it to its limits. Most aftermarket cards come with robust cooling systems, ensuring that your GPU stays cool even during intense gaming sessions.

At a retail price of around $120, the R7 260X offers excellent value for money. It provides a great balance between performance and cost, making it an ideal choice for gamers on a budget. It's the GPU equivalent of finding a vintage Star Wars action figure at a garage sale.

## The Basics

### What is Aquelarre?

Aquelarre, which means 'coven' in Spanish, is one of the pioneering dark fantasy role-playing games set in medieval Spain. The third edition, **Ex Mundo Tenebrarum**, takes the occult elements up a notch, promising deeper lore, more intricate spells, and some seriously creepy adversaries.

### Components

The Deluxe edition comes with:
- **Rulebook**: A beautifully illustrated tome filled with rules, lore, and everything you need to summon your inner demon.
- **Character Sheets**: Because your character is bound to get torn apart several times, so you'll need plenty!
- **Dice**: Specially cursed dice (just kidding, they work fine).
- **Game Master Screen**: To hide your GM’s evil plans, or snacks.

**Pro Tip**: Do not try to summon real demons using the rulebook. Trust me, it doesn’t end well.

## Gameplay

### Setting Up

Setting up Aquelarre is like preparing for a medieval ritual. Lay out your character sheets, dice, and rulebook. Light some candles for ambiance – just don't burn down the house.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players decide on actions such as attacking, casting spells, or attempting diplomacy. The humor often comes from realizing how terrible these actions can go. Think Monty Python meets medieval horror.

### Combat

Combat in Aquelarre is a blend of strategy and sheer chaos. Roll dice to determine the outcome, and remember, just because you're wielding a sword doesn't mean you won't trip over your own feet.

## The Story

### Scenarios

Aquelarre offers a range of scenarios inspired by medieval lore. From battling mythical creatures to uncovering dark secrets, each scenario offers unique challenges and plenty of opportunities for hilarity.

### Characters

Create your own characters, from brave knights to cunning sorcerers. Each character has distinct abilities and traits, ensuring a rich role-playing experience.

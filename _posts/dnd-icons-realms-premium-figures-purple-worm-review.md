## What is the Purple Worm?

The Purple Worm is not just a worm; it's *The Worm*. Imagine the terror of your party when they encounter this gargantuan creature in the dark depths of the earth. The Purple Worm is a staple of D&D lore, known for its massive size, destructive tendencies, and a mouth that can swallow adventurers whole.

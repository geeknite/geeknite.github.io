Let's unravel the secrets of these new characters and see if they're worth adding to your collection.

## The Basics

### What is City of Mist?

Before we get into the character pack, let's give a quick shoutout to the original **City of Mist** RPG. Imagine a game where you play as modern-day sleuths with legendary powers, solving crimes in a city filled with magic and danger. It's like if Sherlock Holmes and Harry Potter had a love child that was raised by Batman. Yeah, it's that cool.

### What's in the Character Pack?

The **Fortune Row Character Pack** includes:

- 5 pre-generated character playbooks
- Detailed backstories and abilities
- Beautifully illustrated character art
- New themes and tropes to explore

These characters aren't just pretty faces; they're deeply integrated into the lore of City of Mist, each bringing unique abilities and stories to your campaign.

## The Characters

### The Gambler

First up, we have the **Gambler**. This character is all about taking risks and making high-stakes bets. With abilities that can alter luck and probability, the Gambler is perfect for players who love to push their luck. Just remember, the house always wins... or does it?

### The Oracle

Next, we have the **Oracle**, a character who can see glimpses of the future. This isn't just about predicting whether it'll rain tomorrow; we're talking about seeing pivotal moments in your campaign and using that knowledge to guide your team. It's like having a magic 8-ball that actually works.

### The Enforcer

The **Enforcer** is your go-to muscle. With superhuman strength and resilience, this character can take and dish out a serious beating. If you've ever wanted to play as a cross between The Rock and a wrecking ball, this is your chance.

## Introduction

Hey there, you fabulous nerds! If you’re a fan of **Smash Up** and looking to take your game to the next level, then you’re in for a treat with **Smash Up: Awesome Level 9000**. This expansion is like adding a jetpack to a roller skate—ridiculously fun and potentially hazardous to your friendships (in the best way possible).

## What is Smash Up: Awesome Level 9000?

Smash Up: Awesome Level 9000 is an expansion for the wildly popular card game Smash Up. In case you’ve been living under a rock (or just binge-watching Netflix), Smash Up is a game where players combine two decks of cards, each representing a different faction, to create a unique and powerful team. The goal? Total domination of bases and superior bragging rights.

### Components

The expansion includes:
- **New Factions**: Steampunk, Ghosts, Bear Cavalry, and Plants. Yes, you can finally live out your dream of commanding an army of plant-powered bears.
- **Base Cards**: New bases offer fresh challenges and opportunities.
- **Tokens**: Because who doesn’t love a good token?

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up Awesome Level 9000 is like setting up a fantasy football team—or a fantasy bear fighting league. Choose your factions, shuffle your decks, and prepare for chaos.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn consists of playing cards from your hand to deploy minions, actions, or special abilities. The goal is to control bases by having the highest total power when a base’s breakpoint is reached. It’s all about timing, strategy, and knowing when to unleash your plant bear cavalry.

### Combat

Combat in Smash Up is more about strategic placement and clever card combinations than direct conflict. Did you plan an epic move only to have your friend’s Ghosts haunt your plans? Welcome to Smash Up, where even the best-laid schemes can go hilariously wrong.

## The Awesome Level

### Factions

One of the best parts of Awesome Level 9000 is the addition of new factions. You can mix Steampunk with Ghosts and create a hauntingly mechanical army, or combine Bear Cavalry with Plants and watch your foes tremble in the face of your horticultural bears.

**Funny Moment**: During one game, a player’s Bear Cavalry was defeated by a sneaky Steampunk move, resulting in a table-wide roar of laughter. Bears! Steam! Plants! This game has it all.

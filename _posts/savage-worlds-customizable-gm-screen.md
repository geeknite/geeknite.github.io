## Introduction

Hello, fellow GMs and RPG aficionados! Today, we're diving into the world of Savage Worlds with a review of the **Savage Worlds Customizable GM Screen**. If you’re a GM who loves to have everything at your fingertips or just wants to hide your notes and secret dice rolls from your players, this screen promises to be your best friend. But does it live up to the hype? Let’s find out!

## The Basics

### What is the Savage Worlds Customizable GM Screen?

The Savage Worlds Customizable GM Screen is a versatile tool designed to help Game Masters (GMs) organize their notes, manage game mechanics, and keep their plans hidden from prying players’ eyes. It features pockets that allow you to insert your own reference sheets, maps, and artwork, making it a personalized fortress of GM knowledge.

### Components

The GM Screen typically comes with:

- **Three-panel screen**: Each panel has a clear plastic pocket for inserting customized sheets.
- **Reference sheets**: Pre-made sheets with essential Savage Worlds rules and tables.
- **Artwork inserts**: Beautifully illustrated inserts that make the screen visually appealing.

**Pro Tip**: Be sure to laminate your inserts to protect them from the inevitable Dorito dust and soda spills.

## Features

### Customization

The highlight of this GM screen is its customization capability. You can swap out the inserts with your own reference sheets, artwork, or maps. This feature allows you to tailor the screen to your specific campaign needs, whether you’re running a classic fantasy adventure or a gritty modern-day scenario.

### Durability

The screen is made of sturdy materials designed to withstand the rigors of game night. After all, it needs to survive the occasional player tantrum and the GM's dramatic flurry of papers.

### Practicality

The pockets are easy to use, and swapping out the inserts is a breeze. The screen also folds flat for storage, making it a convenient tool to carry to and from game sessions.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- **Customizable**: Personalize with your own inserts.
- **Durable**: Built to last through countless game nights.
- **Visually Appealing**: Comes with beautiful artwork inserts.
- **Portable**: Folds flat for easy transport.

### Cons

- **Pricey**: It may be on the expensive side for some GMs.
- **Limited to Savage Worlds**: The pre-made inserts are specific to Savage Worlds rules.

## Funny Quirks

Let’s talk about some of the quirks that make the Savage Worlds Customizable GM Screen unique (and sometimes amusing):

- **Overly Enthusiastic Pockets**: The pockets are so tight that inserting and removing sheets can feel like a workout. By the end of it, you might develop more muscles than your Barbarian character.
- **Attention-Seeking Artwork**: The artwork inserts are stunning, but they might distract your players more than they hide your notes. You’ll find them gazing at the screen instead of listening to your carefully crafted plot twists.

## Comparison with Other GM Screens

### [Dungeons & Dragons DM Screen]({%- post_url 2022-01-15-dnd-dm-screen-review -%})
The Dungeons & Dragons DM Screen offers pre-made inserts with essential rules but lacks customization. If you're running a Savage Worlds campaign, the customizable feature of the Savage Worlds GM screen gives it a significant edge.

### [Pathfinder GM Screen]({%- post_url 2023-05-20-pathfinder-gm-screen-review -%})
While the Pathfinder GM Screen is durable and practical, it doesn’t offer the flexibility to insert personalized sheets. For GMs who love customization, the Savage Worlds screen is the better choice.

## Final Recommendation

The **Savage Worlds Customizable GM Screen** is a fantastic tool for any GM running a Savage Worlds campaign. Its customization feature, durability, and visual appeal make it a valuable addition to your GM toolkit. While it may have some quirks and a higher price tag, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.

If you're serious about running a Savage Worlds campaign and want a reliable, customizable GM screen, the Savage Worlds Customizable GM Screen is definitely worth considering.

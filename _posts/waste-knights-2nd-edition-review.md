## Introduction

Greetings, survivors! Today, we're diving into the rugged and radioactive wilderness of **Waste Knights 2nd Edition**. If you're a fan of intense, post-apocalyptic board games with a side of dark humor, then buckle up and get ready for a wild ride. Grab your gas mask, a can of beans, and let's see if this game is worth scavenging for.

## What is Waste Knights 2nd Edition?

Waste Knights 2nd Edition is a post-apocalyptic adventure board game set in the dangerous and desolate wastelands of Australia. Players take on the roles of rugged survivors known as "Knights" and embark on epic quests, battling mutated creatures, raiders, and other threats while trying to outwit and outlast their opponents.

### Components

The game comes with an impressive array of components, including beautifully illustrated maps, detailed miniatures, and a plethora of cards and tokens. The artwork is top-notch, capturing the gritty and bleak atmosphere of the Australian wasteland.

- **Miniatures**: High-quality and detailed miniatures of the Knights and various enemies you'll encounter.
- **Map Tiles**: Modular map tiles that create a dynamic and ever-changing game board.
- **Cards**: Adventure, equipment, and enemy cards that add depth and variety to the game.
- **Tokens**: Various tokens for tracking health, resources, and other game elements.

**Pro Tip**: Keep the miniatures away from your pets. Trust me, a radioactive kangaroo is the last thing you need.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up Waste Knights 2nd Edition is like preparing for a scavenger hunt in a nuclear wasteland. Lay out the map tiles, distribute character sheets, and shuffle the adventure and equipment cards. Make sure you have plenty of snacks because this setup might take a bit.

Also if you want to spend a little less check for the <a href="{{ site.constants[0].wsib }}/us/solarstorm">Solarstorm bike light</a>&nbsp;which costs a little less and many users are most than happy with them.<br /><br />Also remember that for a good riding illumination you should use 2 lights, as we already stated in our&nbsp;<a href="{%- post_url 2016-01-25-essential-night-riding-safety-tips -%}">essential night riding safety tips</a>,&nbsp;one on the handlebar and the other in the helmet. We will talk about it when we test the light and post a review.<br /><br /><hr /><br />When you enter <a href="https://dx.com/?Utm_rid=27581771&amp;Utm_source=affiliate" rel="nofollow">dealextreme</a>&nbsp;you feel overwhelmed by the <b>big number of items</b>, some similar, some useless&nbsp;and some that you should never buy without a comprehensive quality test, but you can find some interesting gadgets.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a class="image-link" href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sLy_ozW9acY/Vnm1kBgxxFI/AAAAAAAAArA/1p7WRc23JVQ/s1600/dealextreme_coupons%255B1%255D.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sLy_ozW9acY/Vnm1kBgxxFI/AAAAAAAAArA/1p7WRc23JVQ/s320/dealextreme_coupons%255B1%255D.png" width="320" /></a></div>All of our wishlists have some unnecessary items on which you don’t want to spend much, sometimes you just want to experiment or try something of low quality to check if it can be useful to you before buying the real thing.  So, my approach when I go to <a href="https://dx.com/?Utm_rid=27581771&amp;Utm_source=affiliate" rel="nofollow">dealextreme</a> is this one, find something that can be useful or I like but I don’t want to spend much money on it, like, in my opinion, a bike light. We are talking about needs here so maybe for me it's not yet necessary but for other people, like the ones who commute on bike at night, which is indispensable. So, I found that on specialized bike stores there are a lot variety of lights but I don’t have yet experimented with any, so I don’t know which one to get. We should differentiate 2 kinds, I will call them <em>signalizing</em> and <em>lightning, </em>probably have other names but I'm pretty sure that you will understand what I meant. <br /><br /><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /><ul><li><em>Signalizing</em> lights normally come in pairs, one front and one rear, the main idea for them are commuters that go around the city which is visible enough but cars can’t differentiate you. Those don’t make much light but enough to&nbsp;illuminate&nbsp;the front. Normally those are cheap.</li></ul></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /><ul><li><em>Lightning</em>&nbsp;lights&nbsp;normally is a big light, the main idea is to use it on dark roads, they can produce enough light to ride at a decent speed on a dark forest road, but in the other side are bulky and consume a lot of batteries. The price of the good ones is important and some can be around 200$.</li></ul></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;">As the good one are really expensive my idea is to get one of the <em>lightning</em> kind so I can experiment with rides at night or dark, with a backup, if the main light fails, to return safely. I will be checking the reviews and decide soon. Any recommendations to check?<br /><br /><br /><div style="text-align: start;">And remember that with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.putinyourbasket.com/">#WhereToBuy</a>&nbsp;you can compare prices between amazon and ebay.&nbsp;<b>Big Thanks!</b></div></div>

## Features

### The Pip-Boy Replica

The star of the show is undoubtedly the Pip-Boy replica. This wearable gadget is designed to fit a variety of smartphones, transforming them into a working Pip-Boy when paired with the companion app. The level of detail is impressive, with buttons, knobs, and switches that feel satisfying to fiddle with.

### Companion App

The Pip-Boy Companion App allows you to manage your in-game inventory, stats, and map without pausing the game. While it's a fun novelty, the practicality of strapping a bulky device to your arm during gameplay is questionable. Still, it's a great conversation starter and a fantastic piece for cosplay.

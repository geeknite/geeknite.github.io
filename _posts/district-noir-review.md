## Game Overview

### What is District Noir?

District Noir is a strategic card game that pits players against each other in a battle for control over the city's districts. Think of it as Monopoly, but with more strategy and less rage-quitting. The game is designed for 2-4 players and typically lasts about 30 minutes, making it perfect for a quick game night session.

### Game Components

The game comes with:

- 60 beautifully illustrated cards
- A set of rules (which may or may not be followed)
- An intense desire to outwit your friends and claim victory

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Objective

The goal of District Noir is simple: control as many districts as possible. Players take turns playing cards from their hands, each representing different districts with varying points. The player with the most points at the end wins. Sounds easy, right? Well, think again!

### How to Play

1. **Setup**: Shuffle the deck and deal cards to each player. Place the remaining cards face-down in the center.
2. **Turns**: Players take turns drawing cards from the deck or playing one from their hand. Each card represents a district with a specific point value.
3. **Strategy**: Use your cards strategically to claim districts and block opponents. The key is to balance offense and defense. If only life were this simple!
4. **End Game**: The game ends when all cards are played. Count your points and declare a winner. Then, demand a rematch.

Today I was reading the shocking [news of a massive password leak from one of Yahoo's services](http://www.pcworld.com/article/259136/update_yahoo_confirms_450k_voice_passwords_breached.html){: rel="nofollow"}, specifically, around 450k email addresses and passwords where dumped from Yahoo Voices with a relatively simple hacking technique that almost anybody interested in computing could reproduce.

Seems like this is kind of leaks are getting "trendy", it is unbelievable that really big companies like Yahoo or Sony ([a few months ago could just store passwords in text plain in their databases](http://www.informationweek.com/news/security/attacks/229900111){: rel="nofollow"}) or create a webpage vulnerable to SQLInjection, when any decent web developer would not commit such errors, or at least it is what I think, [well sometimes anyone can commit errors but minor in comparison](http://keymuck.blogspot.com.es/2012/01/wtf.html).

Please, use a real password
---------------------------

You should already heard it many times but when I see the statistics of the leaked passwords I can't stop worrying about how people can be so negligent with their personal information.The top password keeps being "123456", probably because, this service required 6 letters for the password :).

If you don't know how a good password, and easy to remember, should be please read [this already famous comic](http://xkcd.com/936/){: rel="nofollow"}. It will be a good idea to change your passwords in important accounts like email, blogging or buying sites.

If you can't keep up with many passwords, there are many free services where you can store passwords securely like [lastPass](https://lastpass.com/){: rel="nofollow"}or use a free program like [KeePass](http://keepass.info/){: rel="nofollow"}.
I am using **KeePass** synced with **dropbox** so I can use my passwords everywhere, it also gives you the option to create secure and random password for new accounts or auto-type your login info in your service. It's a nice and free program!

What can I do if I have an account on Yahoo Voices
-----------------------------------------------------

- First of all, change your password! To a strong one too!
- Second, change all the password to any account on any online service that shared the email registered on Yahoo Voices
- And finally try to stay away from bad or insecure services, try to use a password manager with a good password too
- And the most important be cautious of everything and everyone.

## The Core Game

Before we get into the nitty-gritty of the Grand Tour expansion, let's take a quick refresher on what makes Flamme Rouge such a beloved game. Flamme Rouge is a fast-paced bicycle racing game where players control a team of two cyclists, a Rouleur and a Sprinteur, each with their unique deck of movement cards. The objective?

The Grand Tour expansion introduces several exciting new elements to the game, ensuring that even the most seasoned Flamme Rouge players have something fresh to sink their teeth into.

### New Tracks

One of the highlights of the Grand Tour expansion is the addition of new tracks. These tracks are designed to simulate the grueling multi-stage races seen in real-life grand tours like the Tour de France. Each stage presents unique challenges, from steep climbs to treacherous descents, requiring players to adapt their strategies accordingly.

### Team Management

In Grand Tour, players must manage their team of cyclists through multiple stages. This adds a layer of complexity, as you need to consider fatigue and recovery between stages. Will you push your riders hard in the early stages, or save their energy for a final sprint to glory?

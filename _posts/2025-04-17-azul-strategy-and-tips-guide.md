**Azul** is a tile-laying game designed by Michael Kiesling and published by Plan B Games. It won the prestigious Spiel des Jahres award in 2018, and it's easy to see why. Players take turns drafting tiles from a central board and placing them on their personal boards to complete patterns and score points. The game is simple to learn but offers deep strategic gameplay that keeps players coming back for more.

## Components and Quality

Azul comes with beautifully designed tiles that resemble Portuguese azulejos, a scoring board, player boards, and a bag for drawing tiles. The components are of high quality, and the tiles have a satisfying weight to them, making the game a joy to play.

**Pro Tip**: Keep the tiles away from pets and small children. While they look tasty, they're not edible!

## Basic Strategies

### 1. Draft Wisely

When drafting tiles, always consider not only what you need but also what your opponents might need. Blocking an opponent can sometimes be more beneficial than taking the tiles you want. Pay attention to the central board and try to predict your opponents' moves.

**Funny Moment**: In one game, a player took a tile just to block another player, only to realize it completely messed up their own board. The laughter echoed for hours!

### 2. Plan Ahead

Think about your future moves and how the tiles you draft will fit into your patterns. Avoid drafting tiles that will leave you with unwanted leftovers, which can lead to negative points.

**Pro Tip**: Sometimes it's better to take a penalty than to disrupt your entire strategy. Choose your battles wisely.

### 3. Balance Your Patterns

Try to complete rows and columns simultaneously to maximize your points. Balancing your patterns allows you to score more efficiently and avoid negative points from leftover tiles.

**Criticism Alert**: While focusing on patterns is crucial, it can lead to analysis paralysis for some players. Don't overthink it, or you might end up blocking yourself.

### 4. Watch the Tile Distribution

Keep an eye on the number of tiles left in the bag and on the central board. This will help you predict upcoming moves and plan your strategy accordingly.

**Pro Tip**: Knowing when certain tiles will run out can give you a strategic edge. Use this information to your advantage!

## Advanced Strategies

### 1. The Art of Blocking

Advanced players know the importance of blocking opponents. If you see that an opponent is close to completing a high-scoring pattern, consider drafting the tiles they need to slow them down. This can be a game-changer.

### 2. Optimize Your Bonuses

Focus on completing columns, rows, and sets of the same color to maximize your bonuses. The bonus points can make a significant difference in your final score.

**Funny Moment**: During one game, a player ignored bonuses and focused solely on completing patterns. They ended up losing miserably, proving that bonuses are not to be ignored!

### 3. Adapt to the Game Flow

Be flexible with your strategy. If you see that a particular pattern is becoming difficult to complete, adapt and focus on other patterns. Stubbornness can lead to negative points and lost opportunities.

### 4. Mind the Negative Points

Always be aware of potential negative points from leftover tiles. Plan your moves to minimize these penalties and avoid drafting tiles that don't fit into your strategy.

**Pro Tip**: Sometimes taking a small penalty can save you from a bigger disaster. Don't be afraid to make tough choices.

## Introduction

Welcome, fellow board game enthusiasts! Today, we're going to delve into the world of **7 Wonders: Architects**, the latest installment in the popular 7 Wonders series. If you're a fan of strategy games and love building magnificent wonders (or just love proving you're better than your friends), this game is for you. Prepare for a review filled with fun, strategy, and possibly some ancient curses. Let's get started!

## What is 7 Wonders: Architects?

7 Wonders: Architects is the newest addition to the 7 Wonders family. This game focuses on building one of the ancient wonders of the world, with each player racing to complete their wonder before their opponents. Designed by Antoine Bauza, this game is a streamlined, family-friendly version of the original, making it perfect for both newcomers and seasoned players.

## Components

The game comes with beautifully designed components, including:

- **Wonder Boards**: Each player gets a wonder board with different stages to complete.
- **Cards**: Resource, military, and science cards that help you build your wonder and gain advantages.
- **Tokens**: Various tokens for military victories, progress, and more.
- **Cat Tokens**: Yes, there are cats in the game. Who knew ancient wonders were built with the help of cats?

The artwork is stunning, and the quality of the components is top-notch. It's like holding a piece of history in your hands, but with less dust and more cardboard.

## Gameplay

### Setup

Setting up 7 Wonders: Architects is straightforward. Each player chooses a wonder and places their wonder board in front of them. The cards are shuffled and divided into different decks, and the tokens are placed within reach. Now you're ready to start building!

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players draw a card from one of three decks: the deck to their left, the deck to their right, or the central deck. The objective is to gather resources, advance in science, and build military strength to complete the stages of their wonder.

**Pro Tip**: Keep an eye on your opponents' progress. Nothing is more satisfying than completing your wonder just as your friend is about to finish theirs.

### Building Your Wonder

As you gather resources, you can start building the stages of your wonder. Each stage requires a specific set of resources, and completing a stage grants you special abilities and bonuses. The first player to complete all stages of their wonder wins the game.

**Funny Moment**: During one game, a friend of mine was so focused on gathering resources that he didn't notice he had enough to complete his wonder. We all had a good laugh as he frantically tried to finish before the game ended.

## Strategy and Replayability

7 Wonders: Architects offers plenty of strategic depth, with multiple paths to victory. Whether you focus on military strength, scientific progress, or resource gathering, there are various ways to outwit your opponents. The randomized setup and different wonders ensure that no two games are the same, keeping the replayability high.

## Pros and Cons

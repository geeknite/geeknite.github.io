## Elden Ring on PS5: A Mystical Journey with a Loose Disk

Welcome, fellow Tarnished! Buckle up as we embark on an exhilarating and humorous journey through the lands between in Elden Ring on the PlayStation 5. Whether you’re a seasoned FromSoftware fan or a newcomer to the masochistic joys of their games, this review has something for everyone. Plus, we’ll address that quirky issue of a loose disk inside - because nothing says “epic gaming adventure” like a disk that sounds like it's having its own little party inside the case.

### The Good

1. **Stunning Visuals and Performance**: With the PS5's powerful hardware, Elden Ring's graphics are nothing short of breathtaking. The landscapes are lush, the atmospheres are hauntingly beautiful, and the enemies are detailed enough to make you wince in terror. The game runs smoothly at 60 FPS, ensuring every dodge roll and sword swing feels satisfyingly responsive.

2. **Immersive Open World**: The world of Elden Ring is vast and filled with secrets. From towering castles to eerie forests, every corner of the map beckons for exploration. The seamless transitions between different areas make the experience incredibly immersive.

3. **Challenging Yet Rewarding Combat**: True to FromSoftware's legacy, the combat in Elden Ring is challenging but fair. Every victory feels earned, and every defeat is a lesson in strategy and timing. The new horseback combat adds a refreshing dynamic to the gameplay.

4. **Astounding Lore and Storytelling**: George R.R. Martin's involvement in the lore creation is evident. The narrative is rich with intriguing characters, mythical backstories, and plot twists that will keep you engaged for hours on end.

### The Bad

1. **Steep Learning Curve**: Elden Ring is not for the faint of heart. The game can be unforgiving, especially for newcomers. Expect to die - a lot. But hey, in the words of a wise NPC, “Every death is a lesson.”

2. **Occasional Glitches**: While the game is polished, there are occasional glitches. From enemies getting stuck in walls to the player character performing accidental interpretative dance moves, these glitches can be both frustrating and hilarious.

### The Quirky: The Loose Disk Issue

Ah yes, the infamous loose disk. Imagine our surprise when we eagerly opened the game case only to find the disk rattling around like it was auditioning for a maraca band. Here's a step-by-step guide to handle this situation:

1. **Stay Calm**: Take a deep breath. The game disk is designed to withstand a bit of shaking.

2. **Open the Case Gently**: Carefully open the case to avoid further rattling. If you’re feeling fancy, wear gloves - because why not?

3. **Inspect the Disk**: Check for scratches or damage. If the disk looks like it lost a fight with a cheese grater, contact the retailer for a replacement. Otherwise, you’re good to go!

4. **Secure the Disk**: Place the disk securely on the spindle. Give it a gentle spin to make sure it’s properly seated.

5. **Game On**: Pop that bad boy into your PS5 and let the epic adventure begin!

### Final Thoughts and Recommendation

Despite the minor quirks and challenges, Elden Ring on the PS5 is a must-play for any gaming enthusiast. Its stunning visuals, immersive world, and rewarding gameplay make it a standout title in the action RPG genre. And let’s be honest, the loose disk just adds to the story you’ll tell your friends.

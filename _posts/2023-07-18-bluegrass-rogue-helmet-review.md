This helmet has a distinctive look that sets it apart from other enduro helmets, and it also has some innovative features that make it a great choice for mountain bikers who want to ride hard and have fun.

In this blog post, I'll give you an in-depth review of the Bluegrass Rogue helmet, covering its design, fit, ventilation, safety, and performance. I'll also compare it to some other similar enduro helmets on the market, and show you where you can buy it at a good price. By the end of this post, you'll have a clear idea of whether the Bluegrass Rogue helmet is the right one for you.

## Design

The first thing you'll notice about the Bluegrass Rogue helmet is its design. This helmet has a sleek and modern shape that looks good on any rider. It comes in wide range of different colors, mine in Off-White, something like a grayish with garnet lid. The helmet has a matte finish that gives it a classy and elegant look.

The helmet also has some unique features that make it stand out from other enduro helmets. One of these features is the **visor cutouts** that allow riders to stow eyewear safely in the visor. This is a very handy feature for riders who like to switch between glasses and goggles during their rides. The visor is also adjustable in angle, so you can fine-tune it to your preference.

The Bluegrass Rogue helmet also has some other design elements that enhance its functionality and comfort. For example, it has a **goggle strap clip** at the back that keeps your goggles in place. It also has an **anti-pinch buckle** that prevents your skin from getting caught when you fasten the strap. And it has an **anti-bacterial padding** that keeps your head cool and fresh.

## Fit

The fit of the Bluegrass Rogue helmet is another aspect that makes it a great choice for enduro riders. This helmet has a **wide fit** that accommodates different head shapes and sizes. It also has an **adjustable retention system** that lets you dial in the perfect fit for your head. The retention system is adjustable between three positions in height, and it also has a dial at the back that tightens or loosens the fit around your head.

The Bluegrass Rogue helmet also has a **comfortable fit** that feels snug and secure without being too tight or too loose. The helmet has a **lightweight shell** that weighs only 750 grams (size M), which makes it easy to wear for long periods of time. The helmet also has a **soft padding** that cushions your head and absorbs sweat. The padding is removable and washable, so you can keep it clean and fresh.

## Ventilation

Ventilation is another important factor to consider when choosing an enduro helmet. You want a helmet that keeps your head cool and dry during your rides, especially in hot weather or when you're riding hard. The Bluegrass Rogue helmet does a good job of providing ventilation and airflow to your head.

The Bluegrass Rogue helmet has **16 vents** distributed across the shell. These vents allow air to enter and exit the helmet, creating a cooling effect on your head. The vents are also strategically placed to optimize airflow and prevent overheating. The vents on the front of the helmet are designed to channel air into the visor cutouts, where it can reach your eyewear and prevent fogging. The vents on the top of the helmet are designed to create a negative pressure zone that draws hot air out of the helmet. And the vents on the back of the helmet are designed to exhaust hot air from the rear of the head.

The Bluegrass Rogue helmet also has **internal channels** that connect the vents and create a continuous airflow inside the helmet. These channels help distribute air evenly across your head, keeping it cool and comfortable.

## Safety

Safety is obviously the most important factor to consider when choosing an enduro helmet. You want a helmet that protects your head from impacts and injuries, especially in the event of a crash or a fall. The Bluegrass Rogue helmet offers a high level of safety and protection for your head.

The Bluegrass Rogue helmet has a **durable shell** that is made of polycarbonate and ABS. This shell is designed to withstand impacts and absorb shocks, reducing the risk of head trauma. The shell also has a **multi-density EPS liner** that further enhances the shock absorption and energy dissipation of the helmet.

The Bluegrass Rogue helmet also meets the **safety standards** for enduro helmets. It is certified by CE EN 1078, ASTM F1952-15, ASTM F2032-15, and AS/NZS 2063:2008. These standards ensure that the helmet meets the minimum requirements for impact resistance, retention system performance, and field of vision.

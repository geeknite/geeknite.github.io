## What Makes Mechanical Keyboards Special?

### The Switches

At the heart of every mechanical keyboard is the switch. Unlike their membrane counterparts, mechanical keyboards use individual mechanical switches for each key, providing a distinct tactile feedback. Here's a breakdown of some popular switch types:

- **Cherry MX Red**: Linear and smooth, perfect for gamers who need rapid key presses.
- **Cherry MX Blue**: Clicky and tactile, ideal for typists who love auditory feedback.
- **Cherry MX Brown**: Tactile but quieter, a middle ground for both typing and gaming.

Each switch type offers a different experience, so it's worth trying a few to see which one suits you best.

### Build Quality

Mechanical keyboards are known for their durability. Built with high-quality materials like aluminum and sturdy plastic, these keyboards can withstand the test of time (and the occasional rage quit). Plus, many come with customizable keycaps, allowing you to personalize your keyboard to your heart's content.

### Customization

One of the biggest draws of mechanical keyboards is the level of customization they offer. From programmable RGB lighting to custom keycap sets, you can make your keyboard truly your own. There are even hot-swappable keyboards that let you change out switches without soldering!

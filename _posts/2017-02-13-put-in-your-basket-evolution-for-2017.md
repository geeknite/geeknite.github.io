We are already in 2017, **our site will be 5 years old this year**, and many things have happened and a lot of people has worked with us, the site has evolved in a different direction from how it was conceived initially as a gadgets and opinions blog to talking about gaming to a more sports oriented review site nowadays. This is a factor from the people who have worked with us and from our own life evolution as we grow older we worry about different things, yet we have always been open to talk about anything at [{{ site.title }}](/), so if you are willing to help and love our site [you can work with us](/contact.html).

Of course this is not a goodbye post, **this is a planning for this upcoming year**, of what we want to talk about and what motivates us, what we have scheduled and how you could help us or how can you contribute.

We want to let you know **our new [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRasGTxTdMq8ZpV7NbFLRPA)**, still trying to find our branding and how to best present our videos, but please let us know what would you love to see in our videos. We will be most pleased to hear from you about our [articles with videos](/tags.html#v-video) and let us know how to improve with a comment.

For this next year we expect to complete some of the reviews in our [next articles page](/next-articles.html), many of them long term reviews that require time and some new items that we have bought in the last weeks. We are preparing also an update to our [favorite running gear]({%- post_url 2015-01-19-my-favourite-2015-running-gear-best-gifts-for-runners -%}) and our [favorite mountain biking gear]({%- post_url 2016-04-27-mi-equipacion-favorita-mtb-2016-ideas-regalos-ciclistas -%}) and also a [component](/tags.html#c-components) update list for all with a few years old bike that need a revamp.

Also we are planning to get a full suspension mountain bike and a hardtail with plus tires, also you will have to wait for offers on current models by the end of year, unless there is **a big-hearted bike company that will lend us a bike for a long term review**.

Also at risk of being repetitve we would love to hear ideas and propositions for our site and what products you would like to see or review **check our [contact page](/contact.html)** and also get a reminder of our "motto". **Any help will be most appreciated**! Thanks to all for being there.

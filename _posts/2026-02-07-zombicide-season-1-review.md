## Introduction

Hello, fellow board game enthusiasts and zombie apocalypse survivors! Today, we're diving into the world of **Zombicide: Season 1**, the game that lets you live out your wildest undead fantasies without the risk of turning into a brain-munching monster yourself. So grab your machete, shotgun, and sense of humor, because things are about to get bloody hilarious.

## Gameplay

### Overview

Zombicide: Season 1 is a cooperative board game for 1 to 6 players, where you and your friends take on the roles of survivors in a zombie-infested city. Your mission? Complete various objectives and, of course, stay alive. Sounds easy, right? Well, not when hordes of zombies are trying to make you their next snack.

### Setup

Setting up Zombicide is like preparing for a zombie apocalypse itself. You'll lay out the map tiles, place the spawn points, distribute the survivor cards, and arm yourselves to the teeth. It might take a bit of time, but the anticipation and excitement make it worth the effort.

**Pro Tip**: While setting up, try not to accidentally summon real zombies. It tends to ruin game night.

### Turn Phases

Each turn consists of several phases:

1. **Player Phase**: Survivors perform actions like moving, searching for weapons, attacking zombies, and more.
2. **Zombie Phase**: Zombies move towards the nearest survivors and attack. Spoiler alert: They bite.
3. **End Phase**: Check the board, draw new zombie cards, and prepare for the next round of chaos.

## Characters and Skills

Each survivor comes with unique abilities and skills that can be leveled up as they gain experience points (XP) by killing zombies and completing objectives. Whether you're playing as Ned, the conspiracy theorist, or Wanda, the roller-skating waitress, there's always a fun mix of personalities and skills to explore.

**Funny Moment**: One game, our group decided to role-play our characters to the extreme. Let's just say Wanda's roller-skating escape from a horde is now legendary.

## Zombies, Zombies, and More Zombies

### Zombie Types

Zombicide: Season 1 features several types of zombies, each with its unique abilities and movement patterns:

- **Walkers**: Slow but numerous. They're the bread-and-butter of the zombie world.
- **Runners**: Fast and deadly. They make Usain Bolt look like he's jogging.
- **Fatties**: Tough and hard to kill. They really need to cut down on the human flesh diet.
- **Abominations**: The big bad of the game. If you see one, run or cry. Your choice.

### Zombie Spawn

Zombies spawn at designated points on the map, dictated by the zombie cards drawn each turn. As the game progresses, the number and type of zombies increase, turning the board into a nightmare of rotting flesh and mindless hunger.

## Strategy and Survival

### Teamwork

Surviving Zombicide requires teamwork and strategic thinking. Coordinate with your fellow survivors, plan your moves, and make sure someone always has your back. Trust me, there's nothing worse than facing an abomination alone.

### Resource Management

Managing resources like weapons, ammo, and health is crucial. Searching buildings for items and swapping gear with other survivors can make the difference between life and undeath.

**Pro Tip**: Never underestimate the power of a frying pan as a weapon. It's the ultimate zombie head-smasher.

### Objectives

Completing objectives is key to winning the game. Whether it's reaching a specific location, rescuing other survivors, or collecting vital items, every objective brings its own set of challenges and rewards. Stay focused and remember: Zombies don't care about your goals, they just want your brains.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

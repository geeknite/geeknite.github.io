## Introduction

Welcome, wordsmiths and aspiring secret agents! Today, we're diving into the thrilling world of the **Codenames Card Game**. If you've ever dreamed of being a master spy while flexing your vocabulary muscles, then this game is the perfect blend of espionage and wordplay. Prepare for a night of cunning clues, daring guesses, and maybe a bit of laughing at your friends' terrible code-cracking skills.

## What is Codenames?

Codenames is a party game designed for 2-8 players where teams compete to uncover their secret agents hidden among a grid of words. Each team has a spymaster who provides one-word clues to help their teammates find the words that correspond to their agents while avoiding the words that belong to the other team and the deadly assassin.

### Components

The game includes:
- **Word Cards**: A deck of cards with various words that make up the grid.
- **Key Cards**: Cards that show which words belong to each team and which is the assassin.
- **Spymaster Screens**: To keep the key cards hidden from the guessers.
- **Agent Cards**: Cards to cover the words that have been correctly guessed.
- **Timer**: For those who think wordplay should come with a time limit.

**Pro Tip**: Keep snacks away from the word cards. Greasy fingerprints are not part of the espionage aesthetic.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up Codenames is as easy as arranging a covert operation. Lay out 25 word cards in a 5x5 grid, randomize the key card, and choose your spymasters. The rest of the team should be prepared to decipher some cryptic clues.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, the spymaster provides a one-word clue followed by a number that indicates how many words on the grid relate to that clue. The guessers then deliberate and choose words they believe match the clue. Correct guesses get covered by their team's agent cards, incorrect guesses might reveal the other team's agents or the dreaded assassin, ending the game immediately.

### Strategy and Deduction

Codenames shines in its strategic depth and deduction skills. As the spymaster, you must carefully craft clues that can link multiple words together without leading your team into a trap. For guessers, communication and logical reasoning are key. You'll need to work together to understand the spymaster's thought process and crack the code.

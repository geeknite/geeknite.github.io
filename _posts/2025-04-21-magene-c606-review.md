## Introduction

Today, we're diving into the world of budget-friendly bike computers with the **Magene C606**. It's affordable, packed with features, and... well, let's just say it has its quirks. If you're looking for a GPS bike computer that won't break the bank, this might be the one for you. Let's get rolling!

## Pros

Let's start with the good stuff. First and foremost, the price is fantastic. At under $100, the C606 offers features that you'd typically find in devices costing twice as much. It's a great option for those who want a functional GPS bike computer without selling a kidney.

But don't let the price fool you. This computer works well and has many customization screens that are useful. The device comes with **customizable screens**, which is a big plus for data nerds like me. Want to track your speed, cadence, heart rate, and the number of squirrels you pass on your ride? You can set it all up (well, maybe not the squirrels).

Another highlight is its **compatibility with Garmin mounts**. If you've already invested in a Garmin mount, you won't need to buy a new one. Plus, the device is waterproof (IPX7), so it can handle rainy rides‚Äîthough it won't stop you from complaining about the weather.

## Cons (Brace Yourself)

Now, let's talk about the not-so-great parts. First up, the **buttons**. Oh, the buttons. They're not intuitive, and using them feels like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube while riding a bike. The lack of a touchscreen is understandable at this price point, but the button layout could definitely use some love.

The **app experience** is another sore spot. While it has improved over time, it's still clunky and feels like it was designed as an afterthought. And if you're in the U.S., prepare to embrace the metric system because the app stubbornly refuses to switch to imperial units. Want to see your speed in miles per hour? Too bad‚Äîkilometers per hour it is. Maybe it's a subtle nudge to get Americans to adopt the metric system?

The **instructions** are another weak point. Or should I say, the lack of instructions? Setting up the device feels like a scavenger hunt, except the treasure is frustration. If you're the type who likes to figure things out on your own, this might be a fun challenge. For everyone else, good luck.

The **basic handlebar mount** is, frankly, disappointing. For a device that borders on premium, the mount feels like an afterthought. Thankfully, it's compatible with Garmin mounts, so you can upgrade without too much hassle.

## Not So Good, Not So Bad

Uploading activities to Strava is... an adventure. Once you figure it out, it's straightforward, but the initial setup might leave you scratching your head. The navigation system is functional but far from perfect. It gets the job done, but don't expect it to rival high-end models like the [Garmin Edge 530]({%- post_url 2022-12-28-garmin-edge-530-facts-consider-before-buying -%}).

On the bright side, transferring routes from Komoot works seamlessly, which is a handy feature for those who love planning their rides in advance.

The **screen** is big and readable, which is great. However, it's not a touchscreen, and the buttons (yes, we're back to the buttons) make navigation a bit of a chore. Pro tip: spend some time playing around with the device before your first ride to avoid mid-ride frustration.

## Comparison with Other Bike Computers

### [Garmin Edge 530]({%- post_url 2022-12-28-garmin-edge-530-facts-consider-before-buying -%})
The Garmin Edge 530 offers advanced training features, better navigation, and a more polished app experience. However, it comes at a significantly higher price point. If you're serious about cycling and have the budget, it's worth considering.

### [iGPSPORT IGS630]({%- post_url 2023-03-26-igpsport-igs630-review-great-value-bike-computer-minor-flaws -%})
The iGPSPORT IGS630 is a budget-friendly bike computer with solid features and minor flaws. It's accurate, affordable, and gets the job done. Just be prepared for a bit of a learning curve and some minor frustrations along the way.

### [iGPSPORT BSC300]({%- post_url 2023-06-27-igpsport-bsc300-review-smart-affordable-bike-sensor -%})
The BSC300 is a more affordable alternative within the iGPSPORT lineup. While it lacks some of the advanced features of the IGS630, it's a great entry-level option for casual riders.

## Conclusions

So, is the Magene C606 worth it? If you're looking for a budget-friendly GPS bike computer with solid features and can tolerate a few quirks, the answer is yes. It's accurate, affordable, and gets the job done. Just be prepared for a bit of a learning curve and some minor frustrations along the way.

At the time of writing this review, [the Magene C606 is priced at $99.99 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09XX5FVHJ?tag={{ site.constants.amazon_com }}&linkId=635da0370c647bf7e7ac29d87b70330a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl){: rel="nofollow"}. I would recommend purchasing a [separate mount]({{ site.constants.wsib }}gps bike mount) for this, which should cost around $15 [check {{ site.constants.wsibName }} to find good priced options]({{ site.constants.wsib }}). Even with the extra mount, this is still an exceptional price for a full-color bike computer with so many features.

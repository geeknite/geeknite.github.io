## Introduction

Welcome, fellow Planeswalkers and Tolkien aficionados! Today, we embark on an epic journey through **Magic The Gathering: Lord of the Rings. Tales of Middle-earth Commander Deck**. If you've ever wanted to wield magic in Middle-earth and beat Sauron at his own game, this deck is your passport to adventure. But is it worth your gold coins (or mithril, if you have any)? Let's find out!

## What is the Tales of Middle-earth Commander Deck?

Magic The Gathering: Lord of the Rings. Tales of Middle-earth Commander Deck is a special set that combines the strategic depth of Magic The Gathering with the rich lore of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth. If you love slinging spells and battling foes in the world of hobbits, elves, and orcs, this deck is for you.

### Components

The pack includes:
- **Four Commander Decks**: Each themed around iconic characters and factions from Middle-earth.
- **Exclusive Foil Cards**: Shiny cards that make your deck look like it was blessed by Galadriel.
- **Detailed Instruction Booklet**: Because even Gandalf needed to study once in a while.
- **Life Counters and Tokens**: Essential for tracking the chaos you'll unleash.

**Pro Tip**: Keep your precious cards safe from Gollum. He has sticky fingers.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up your Tales of Middle-earth Commander Deck is like preparing for the Council of Elrond. Lay out your cards, choose your commander, and shuffle your deck. Make sure to have enough space for your epic battles – the fate of Middle-earth depends on it!

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players draw cards, play lands, cast spells, and summon creatures. The goal is to use your unique commander to lead your forces and defeat your opponents. But beware, the Dark Lord has tricks up his sleeve.

### Special Abilities

The deck's special abilities are thematic and powerful. Want to summon an army of ents? You got it. Need to sneak past an opponent's defenses like a hobbit? No problem. Each card brings the flavor of Middle-earth to life.

## The Middle-earth Magic

### The Decks

The four included decks are themed around different factions:
- **The Fellowship Deck**: Join Frodo, Aragorn, and Gandalf on their quest to destroy the One Ring.

- **The Elves Deck**: Utilize the grace and power of the elves to outmaneuver your foes.
- **The Dwarves Deck**: Show off your resilience and strength with Gimli and his kin.

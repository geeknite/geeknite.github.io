If you're looking at a [GoPro Hero Session]({{ site.constants.wsib }}GoPro Hero Session) in 2025, you're probably weighing its low price against newer options. The short answer: buy one only if you need a ultra-compact, waterproof camera for casual use under €50. For anything more demanding, a [GoPro Hero 12]({{ site.constants.wsib }}GoPro Hero 12) or [DJI Osmo Action 4]({{ site.constants.wsib }}DJI Osmo Action 4) delivers far better results.

## Hardware: Small but Limited by Today's Standards

The [GoPro Hero Session]({{ site.constants.wsib }}GoPro Hero Session) is compact and solid, but the specs show their age:

| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Video Resolution** | 1440p at 30fps, 1080p at 60fps      | 5.3K at 60fps        |
| **Photo Resolution** | 8MP                                 | 27MP                 |
| **Waterproof**       | Up to 33 ft (10m) without a housing | Up to 33 ft (10m)    |

## Performance: Acceptable for Casual Use

- **Video Quality**: The Hero Session captures decent footage in good lighting but struggles significantly in low-light conditions. For daytime outdoor activities, results are acceptable.
- **Stabilization**: No electronic stabilization means shaky footage in dynamic situations. Budget gimbals or post-processing stabilization can compensate, but newer cameras like the [DJI Osmo Action 4]({{ site.constants.wsib }}DJI Osmo Action 4) handle this natively.
- **Ease of Use**: Single-button control makes it the simplest action camera to operate. Press once and it records — no menus, no settings to fiddle with.

---

## Durability: The Session's Strongest Point

The standout feature remains its build quality. Waterproof to 10m without a housing, impact-resistant, and small enough to mount anywhere. This ruggedness is what keeps the Session relevant as a secondary or disposable camera for situations where you wouldn't risk an expensive model.

---

## Compatibility: GoPro Ecosystem

The Hero Session is compatible with standard [GoPro mounts]({{ site.constants.wsib }}GoPro mounts accessories), which is a significant advantage — the mount ecosystem is massive. Helmets, handlebars, chest harnesses, adhesive mounts — all work without adapters.

---

## Battery Life: The Built-in Limitation

Two hours of continuous recording is adequate for most sessions. The critical limitation: the battery is built-in and non-replaceable. Once it degrades after a few years of use, the camera's useful life ends. If buying used, verify battery health before purchasing.

## Introduction

Welcome, fellow wizards, warriors, and board game aficionados! Today, we embark on an epic journey into the heart of Middle-earth with the **Strategy Battle Game** rules. Grab your elven cloaks, dust off your dwarf axes, and prepare for a quest filled with tactical maneuvers, strategic depth, and a pinch of hobbit hilarity.

## The Basics

### What is Middle-earth: Strategy Battle Game?

The Middle-earth: Strategy Battle Game (SBG) is a tabletop miniatures game where players command forces from the rich lore of J.R.R. Tolkien's universe. Whether you're leading the armies of Gondor or orchestrating the malevolent plans of Mordor, this game captures the essence of Middle-earth battles in a strategic format.

### Components

The game includes beautifully crafted miniatures, representing various characters and units from the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit series. The detailed artwork and high-quality components ensure an immersive gaming experience. Plus, you'll get a rulebook thicker than a dwarf's beard, packed with stats, special abilities, and enough lore to make any Tolkien fan swoon.

**Pro Tip**: Don't let your Balrog near the candles. Flaming disasters are only cool in Mordor!

## The Concept

### What is Utopia?

'Utopia: Vision d'un besseren Welt' is a series of posters that portray an ideal world. Think of it as a Pinterest board curated by philosophers, artists, and that one friend who insists on pointing out life’s ironies. Each poster is designed to make you reflect, smile, and perhaps, reconsider your life choices.

### Artistic Style

The posters feature a blend of contemporary and classical art styles. Imagine Picasso meeting Banksy and deciding to create something that could end up in both the Louvre and your local coffee shop. The result is a collection of visually stunning, thought-provoking pieces.

## The Posters

A society where everyone gets along, and there's no need for “reply all” in emails. This poster might be a bit optimistic, but hey, we can dream.

### Poster 4: The Eco-Friendly World

A world where sustainability isn’t just a buzzword. Trees are as common as Wi-Fi, and everyone knows how to recycle. Greta Thunberg would be proud.

Smiles are contagious, and happiness is the norm. It’s like a Disney movie, but without the talking animals.

Artists are celebrated, and creativity is encouraged. Think of it as a never-ending art festival, but without the pretentious critics.

### Poster 8: The Peaceful World

Conflict is a thing of the past, and world leaders actually agree on stuff—because they finally realized that peace is kinda important.

### Poster 9: The Health Paradise

Everyone’s fit, and the concept of “waiting room” is obsolete. It’s like your gym and hospital decided to adopt zen principles.

### Poster 10: The Ultimate Freedom

Freedom isn’t just a concept; it’s a way of life. People are free to be who they want, without judgment. Your quirky uncle would love it here.

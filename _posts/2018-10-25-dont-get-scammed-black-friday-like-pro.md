In a month the most consumerist week of the year will take place, yes it's Black Friday again, a US tradition that has been exported worldwide and, probably, gives us the best offers of the year just before the Christmas season.

**From the experience of our top buyers we will give you 5 tips on how to not getting scammed on Black Friday and get the most of it**:

1. **Prepare now**, do a list of what you need or want to buy and **do your homework**, look for models, prices and alternatives. Every year offers start sooner, so expect that next week by November 1st some store will start moving. Having the reference of the usual price (not the MSRP) will give you a better perspective deciding if it is a good or an average offer.
2. **Consider availability**. Start looking these previous offers, but don't be too hasty. Some stores will start with some not so good offers but if the product you want is highly sought you will have difficulties finding it on Black Friday day.
3. **Check your local stores**. Due to the big boom of online stores seems like we forgot local stores to get good offers, but every year they are getting more in the loop of Black Friday to get their cake piece, so if you can check your local stores there could be also good offers.
4. **Don't rush.**I know it's a flash offer and it will go away soon, but it's better to not have something that getting something useless. Even if you did not prepare if it is a good offer make a fast check on [Where Should I buy]({{ site.constants[0].wsib }}) and it will give you an average idea of the price comparing amazon and ebay, also showing you historic prices and recommendations.
5. **Stick to the list**. It's a really good offer buy do I need it? Really? Sure? Ask it 3 times before buying if it is not on your initial list.

That's all for now, we are pretty sure that we will be talking more about Black Friday, it's getting near, get ready!

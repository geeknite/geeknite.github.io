## Painting Tips

For those new to painting miniatures, don’t worry! Here are some tips to make your Reidane look as divine as she deserves:

### Prep Work

Before you start painting, ensure you wash the miniature with soapy water to remove any mold release agents. This will help the paint adhere better. Prime the miniature with a good primer to provide a solid base for your paint.

Reidane’s color scheme typically includes whites and golds, representing her divine nature. Here are some suggested paints:

- **Vallejo White**
- **Citadel Retributor Armour (for the gold parts)**
- **Army Painter Soft Tone (for shading)**

### Techniques

1. **Base Coating**: Start by applying a base coat to all the areas. Remember, thin layers are key.
2. **Shading**: Use a wash (like Army Painter Soft Tone) to add depth to the folds in her robes and other recessed areas.

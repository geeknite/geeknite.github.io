## **Features: Brightness Levels and USB Charging**

This lamp isn't just a pretty face—it comes with practical features that make it a versatile addition to your home.

### **Three Brightness Levels**

The lamp offers three brightness levels, so you can adjust the light to suit your mood. Whether you're reading a book, working on a project, or setting the ambiance for a romantic dinner, this lamp has you covered.

### **USB Charging**

One of the best features of this lamp is its built-in USB charging port. Say goodbye to hunting for a wall outlet—just plug in your phone or tablet and charge away while you bask in the lamp's glow.

**Criticism**: While the USB charging port is a great addition, some users mentioned that it doesn't provide fast charging. So if you're in a hurry, you might want to stick to your usual charger.

## **Performance: Shining Bright or Dimly Lit?**

Let's talk about how well this lamp performs in real-world scenarios.

### **Brightness Levels**

The three brightness levels are genuinely useful. The lowest setting is perfect for a cozy atmosphere, while the highest setting is bright enough for detailed tasks. However, some users noted that the highest setting isn't as bright as they expected, which might be disappointing for those who need a lot of light.

### **USB Charging Speed**

As mentioned earlier, the USB charging port is handy but not the fastest. It's sufficient for overnight charging, but if you need a quick top-up, you might be left waiting.

---

## **Funny Quirks**

No product review is complete without mentioning the funny quirks that make it unique.

### **Overenthusiastic Switch**

The lamp's switch is quite responsive—sometimes too responsive. A slight brush can change the brightness setting, leaving you in the dark (or light) unexpectedly. It's like the lamp is playing a prank on you!

### **Crystal Shade Drama**

The crystal shade can be a bit of a diva. It loves to show off its sparkle but can be a dust magnet. So if you don't want to spend your weekends cleaning, you might want to keep a duster handy.

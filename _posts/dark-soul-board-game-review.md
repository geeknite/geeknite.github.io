**Pro Tip**: Keep a bucket of spare miniatures handy. Just in case your rage-induced table flip sends a few flying.

## Gameplay

### Setting Up

Setting up Dark Souls – The Board Game is a ritual in itself. Lay out the board, arrange the miniatures, and prepare your character sheets. You might want to have a snack break, because this setup is as complex as a multi-phase boss fight.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players draw cards and perform actions like moving, attacking, and using special abilities. The game incorporates a unique stamina system, requiring players to balance their actions carefully – overexertion leads to exhaustion, and exhaustion leads to death. Trust me, you don't want to be that guy who keeled over because they swung their sword one too many times.

### Combat

Combat in Dark Souls is strategic and unforgiving. Players must coordinate their attacks and defenses, using their skills and equipment to outmaneuver enemies. Remember, timing is everything – one wrong move, and you might find yourself on the receiving end of a particularly nasty combo.

## The Dark Souls Experience

### Memorable Moments

One of the standout features of Dark Souls – The Board Game is the memorable moments it creates. From epic boss battles to hilarious mishaps, every game session is filled with stories worth retelling.

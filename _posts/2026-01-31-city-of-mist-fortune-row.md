## Introduction

Welcome, fellow geeks and mystery aficionados! Today, we're diving headfirst into the enigmatic world of **City of Mist: Fortune Row**, a game that promises urban intrigue, supernatural abilities, and enough plot twists to make your head spin. So grab your magnifying glass and trench coat; it's time to solve some mysteries!

## The Basics

### What is City of Mist: Fortune Row?

City of Mist: Fortune Row is a role-playing game set in a noir-inspired city where players embody characters with mythic abilities. These abilities range from superhuman strengths to mystical powers, offering a unique blend of modern-day detective work and ancient legends. Think of it as *Sherlock Holmes* meets *Percy Jackson*, but with more smoke and jazz.

### Components

The game comes with an array of well-designed components, including:
- **Character Folios**: Detailed character sheets that outline abilities, backstories, and potential plot hooks.
- **Deck of Mythos and Logos Cards**: These cards represent your mythic and ordinary abilities.
- **Game Board**: Various locations within the City of Mist for players to explore.
- **Tokens and Markers**: Used to keep track of clues, statuses, and other game elements.

**Pro Tip**: Keep the tokens away from pets. Cats might think they're tasty treats, and dogs may try to solve the mystery themselves.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up City of Mist: Fortune Row is like preparing for a theatrical play. It requires careful planning and maybe a few dramatic monologues. Lay out the character folios, distribute cards, and set up the game board. Now you're ready to embark on your adventure.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players draw cards and take actions based on their character's abilities. You can investigate clues, confront suspects, and uncover secrets. Cooperation is key, so strategize with your fellow detectives to make the most of your mythic powers.

### Combat

Combat in City of Mist: Fortune Row is a blend of strategy and narrative. Each character's abilities and weaknesses play a role, and the outcome often hinges on creative problem-solving rather than brute force.

## The Concept: A Better World

### Vision of Utopia

"Utopia: Vision d'un besseren Welt" translates to "Utopia: Vision of a Better World," and boy, does it deliver on that promise. This wall print captures the essence of a perfect world, where everything is harmonious, vibrant, and just plain beautiful. Imagine waking up every morning to a scene that looks like it was borrowed from a dream... minus the talking unicorns, of course.

### Artist's Perspective

The artist behind this masterpiece is none other than Franz H. Utopius. Renowned for his ability to blend surrealism with realism, Utopius creates scenes that are both fantastical and grounded. His vision for this wall print was to encapsulate the ideal world—one where nature thrives, cities are green, and people coexist in peace.

**Funny Moment:** During an interview, Utopius mentioned that he initially included flying pigs in the artwork but decided against it, fearing it might be a bit too "porky" for viewers.

**Hello Geeknite readers!** Today, we're diving deep into a piece of tech history: the iPhone 6s. It's 2025, and while Apple is busy launching iPhone 17 or whatever, let's take a moment to appreciate one of their classic models. So, is the iPhone 6s still worth buying, or is it as outdated as your grandma's flip phone? Let's find out!

## **Design and Build Quality**

The iPhone 6s still holds up in terms of design. With its sleek aluminum body and compact size, it feels premium and comfortable in hand. Available in four colors-Silver, Gold, Space Gray, and Rose Gold-there's a nostalgic charm to its aesthetics. The build quality is solid, and it could probably survive a few accidental drops (not that we're recommending you try it).

## **Display**

The iPhone 6s features a 4.7-inch Retina display with a resolution of 1334x750 pixels. Sure, it's not as vibrant as the latest OLED screens, but it gets the job done. The colors are decent, and the brightness is adequate for most lighting conditions.

## **Performance**

Under the hood, the iPhone 6s is powered by the A9 chip, coupled with 2GB of RAM. Yes, it's ancient by today's standards, but it can still handle everyday tasks like browsing, social media, and even light gaming. Just don't expect it to run the latest AAA titles or handle intense multitasking without a sweat.

## **Camera**

The iPhone 6s comes with a 12MP rear camera and a 5MP front camera. While it's no match for modern smartphone cameras, it takes decent photos in good lighting conditions. The night mode is practically non-existent, so don't expect great results in low light. Selfies are handled reasonably well, though you might need a filter or two to get that Instagram-worthy shot.

## **Battery Life**

One of the weak points of the iPhone 6s is its battery life. The 1715mAh battery struggles to last a full day of heavy use. If you're planning on using it as your primary device, you'll need to keep a charger handy. On the bright side, it supports fast charging, so you can juice it up quickly when needed.

> **Pro Tip:** Replace the battery at an authorized service center for $49 - it'll breathe new life into your old iPhone 6s!

## **Software**

The iPhone 6s runs iOS 15, and while it's not the latest version, it's still smooth and functional. Apple has done a good job of supporting older devices, though you might miss out on some of the newer features. Expect occasional lag and slower performance compared to the latest models.

## **Price and Availability**

In 2025, you can find the iPhone 6s for a bargain price. It's available on platforms like [eBay and Amazon]({{ site.constants.wsib }}iphone-6s), making it an affordable option for those who need a secondary device or are on a tight budget.

## Conclusion

The iPhone 6s is a solid device that still holds some charm in 2025. It has a premium design, decent display, and reliable performance for basic tasks. While its camera and battery life are lacking compared to modern smartphones, it's hard to beat the value it offers at its current price point.

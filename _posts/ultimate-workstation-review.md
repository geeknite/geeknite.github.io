## Setup and Assembly

So, you're excited about your new workstation and ready to get it up and running. But wait! There's assembly required. Cue the dramatic music.

### The Instructions

The instructions for the Eternal Workstation are like a treasure map. They're filled with diagrams, numbers, and more arrows than Legolas' quiver. If you've ever built a PC using eBay components, you'll be right at home here. Just remember, patience is a virtue.

### The Actual Assembly

With the instructions in hand, you begin the assembly process. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Prepare Your Workspace**: Clear a space, lay out your components, and grab your tools. If your desk looks like a tornado hit it, take a moment to tidy up.
2. **Connect the Frame**: Assemble the frame and secure it with screws. Make sure it's sturdy enough to withstand your caffeine-fueled typing.
3. **Install the Screens**: Attach the screens to the frame. Just make sure they're facing the right way – unless you enjoy staring at the back of a screen.
4. **Add the Desks**: Place the desks on the frame and secure them. Now you're starting to see the workstation come to life.
5. **Cable Management**: Tidy up the cables for optimal airflow and aesthetics. Use zip ties if necessary.
6. **Final Touches**: Add any additional components, like monitor stands or keyboard trays. Now, step back and admire your handiwork.

## Real-World Performance

### Space Utilization

With dimensions like these, the Eternal Workstation is a space hog. But it's also a space saver. Confused? Let me explain. By accommodating ten people in one setup, you can maximize your office space and reduce clutter. It's like a TARDIS – bigger on the inside.

## Gameplay

### Setting Up

Setup is straightforward. Players choose their investigator and cultist roles secretly, shuffle the deck of event cards, and distribute tokens and miniatures on the board. Prepare for an evening of deceit and deduction.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players move their miniatures, discuss their findings, and perform actions like investigating locations, revealing clues, or sabotaging efforts (if you're a cultist). Communication is key, but trust no one.

### Social Deduction

The game shines in its social deduction mechanics. As an investigator, you must uncover clues while avoiding the trap set by cultists. As a cultist, sowing doubt and chaos is your primary objective. Accuse wisely, as pointing fingers at the wrong person can lead to disastrous consequences.

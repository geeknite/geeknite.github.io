## Design and Build Quality

The CyberPower Pro Rack Tower is built like a tank. With a 2U rack-mountable design, it fits perfectly in your server rack or can stand tall as a tower. The matte black finish gives it a sleek, professional look that says, “I mean business.”

### ECO Mode

For the eco-conscious geeks out there, the ECO Mode feature reduces energy consumption when the UPS is idle. Save the planet and your electricity bill at the same time!

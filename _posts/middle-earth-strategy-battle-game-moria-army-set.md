## Introduction

Welcome, brave adventurers and tabletop enthusiasts! Today, we're venturing into the dark, goblin-infested mines of Moria with the **Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game: Moria Army Set**. If you're a fan of Tolkien's world and love strategic board games, this set promises an epic combination of both. Prepare for a journey filled with laughter, fierce battles, and maybe a few Balrog-related mishaps.

## What is the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game: Moria Army Set?

The Moria Army Set is a strategic tabletop game that allows players to recreate battles from the depths of Moria. With beautifully detailed miniatures, intricate gameplay mechanics, and a host of goblins to slay, this game offers an immersive experience that will keep you engaged for hours.

### The Basics

In the Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game: Moria Army Set, players command armies and engage in tactical battles. Each player controls a force of goblins, dwarves, or other creatures, each with unique abilities and characteristics. The goal is to complete missions, defeat your opponents, and maybe even face the dreaded Balrog.

### Components

The game comes with:
- **Miniatures**: Stunningly detailed miniatures of goblins, dwarves, and other denizens of Moria. These are so well-crafted, you might want to display them proudly on your shelf.
- **Cards**: Each unit has a deck of cards representing their abilities, actions, and special powers.
- **Game Board**: Various locations from the mines of Moria where battles and missions take place.
- **Tokens and Markers**: Used to track progress, health, and various effects during the game.

**Pro Tip**: Don't let your cat near the miniatures. Those claws are the real supervillains.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up the Moria Army Set is like preparing for a grand adventure. It requires careful planning and maybe a snack break (or two). Lay out the game board, distribute cards and miniatures, and choose your army. Now you're ready to begin your quest.

### Combat

Combat in the Moria Army Set is a blend of strategy and luck. Each unit has unique combat mechanics that add challenges and twists to the game. Did you plan an epic attack just to have a goblin dodge it? Welcome to Moria, where plans often go awry.

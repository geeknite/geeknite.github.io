## Introduction

Welcome, history buffs and war strategy enthusiasts! Today we're diving into the dramatic world of Shiloh with the Folio Series: **Shiloh - Grant Surprised**. Get ready for tales of surprise attacks, heroic blunders, and enough Civil War drama to make your history teacher proud. Buckle up, because we're about to march into one of the most unexpected battles in history.

## Plot Overview

Imagine this: it's April 6, 1862. Ulysses S. Grant is chilling like a villain near Pittsburg Landing, thinking he's got this whole war thing under control. Little does he know, Confederate forces under General Albert Sidney Johnston are sneaking up on him, ready to give him a wake-up call he won't forget.

The Battle of Shiloh, also known as the Battle of Pittsburg Landing, was one of the major early engagements of the American Civil War. It was a brutal slugfest that caught everyone off guard (except maybe the Confederates), and it taught both sides a thing or two about the harsh realities of war.

## Key Figures

### Ulysses S. Grant

Our protagonist, Ulysses S. Grant, is often portrayed as the Union's rockstar general. But at Shiloh, he might've been better suited for a comedy routine. He was so confident in his position that he didn't fortify his camps or send out enough scouts. Classic Grant.

### Albert Sidney Johnston

On the other side, we have Albert Sidney Johnston, the Confederate general with a flair for drama. Johnston launched a surprise attack that nearly wiped out Grant's forces, showing that he wasn't just good at war tactics—he was also great at keeping secrets.

## The Battle

### Day 1: Surprise, Surprise!

The Confederates launched their attack at dawn, catching Grant's men with their coffee cups still in hand. Chaos ensued, with Union soldiers scrambling to defend themselves. Despite the initial confusion, Grant managed to rally his troops, setting the stage for a counterattack.

### Day 2: The Comeback Kid

Grant wasn't one to back down easily. On the second day of the battle, he led a counteroffensive that pushed the Confederates back, reclaiming lost ground and securing a hard-fought victory. So, while Grant may have been surprised, he sure knew how to make a comeback.

### Surprise and Strategy

## Introduction

When it comes to classroom tech storage, the LapCabby UniCabby 20 Horizontal is the Chuck Norris of storage solutions. Need to store and charge 20 devices? No problem. Looking for a robust and secure cart that can also double as a battering ram? You've got it. But does it live up to the hype? Let's dive in.

## Design and Build Quality

The LapCabby UniCabby 20 Horizontal sports an exterior that's tougher than a cyborg's bicep. Constructed with durable materials, this cart is designed to withstand the rigors of a classroom environment (and possibly a zombie apocalypse). Each unit is meticulously crafted, ensuring both durability and functionality.

### Features

**Device Compatibility**: The UniCabby 20 Horizontal can accommodate a wide range of devices, including tablets, Chromebooks, and laptops up to 15.6 inches. If your device fits in a standard backpack, it's likely to fit in the UniCabby.

**Charging Capability**: This cart isn't just about storage—it's a charging powerhouse. Each slot is equipped with a cable management system that ensures your devices are charged without the usual spaghetti junction of cables.

**Security**: With a dual locking system, your devices are safer than gold bars in Fort Knox. The UniCabby 20 Horizontal is designed to keep prying hands at bay.

### Performance

In real-world use, the UniCabby 20 Horizontal performs like a champ. It rolls smoothly on its castor wheels, making it easy to maneuver around the classroom. The ventilation system keeps devices cool, even during heavy use, and the timer function allows you to schedule charging times to avoid overcharging.

### Usability

Setting up the UniCabby 20 Horizontal is like assembling a piece of IKEA furniture, but without the tears and leftover screws. The cable management system is intuitive, and the adjustable shelves accommodate a variety of device sizes. Teachers have praised its ease of use, and students appreciate the quick access to their charged devices.

### Comparison with Competitors

How does the UniCabby 20 Horizontal stack up against the competition? Let's compare it with two other popular models: the **Bretford PowerSync Cart 40** and the **Anthro Yes Cart for Tablets**.

#### Bretford PowerSync Cart 40

The Bretford PowerSync Cart 40 is a behemoth that can charge up to 40 devices simultaneously. While it offers more capacity, it lacks the sleek design and maneuverability of the UniCabby 20 Horizontal. Additionally, the PowerSync Cart 40 comes with a significantly higher price tag.

#### Anthro Yes Cart for Tablets

The Anthro Yes Cart for Tablets is another solid choice, particularly for schools with a focus on tablets. However, its fixed shelves make it less versatile than the adjustable shelves of the UniCabby 20 Horizontal. Plus, the UniCabby's superior security features give it an edge.

## Funny Quirks

No product is perfect, and the UniCabby 20 Horizontal is no exception. Here are a few quirks that add character to this powerhouse:

- **The Cable Octopus**: Despite its cable management system, you'll occasionally find a rogue cable trying to escape. It's like the cart has its own mischievous personality.

- **The Rolling Thunder**: While it's easy to maneuver, the UniCabby 20 Horizontal can be a bit noisy on certain floors. It's like a friendly reminder that your tech guardian is on the move.

## Conclusion

So, is the LapCabby UniCabby 20 Horizontal worth it? Absolutely. It's a stellar solution for schools and institutions looking to store and charge multiple devices securely and efficiently. Its blend of durability, functionality, and security makes it a top choice.

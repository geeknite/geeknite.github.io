This isn't just any dial indicator; this is a dial indicator that probably has its own fan club. It measures movement in increments as tiny as 0.001 inches.

### Custom-Made Miter Bar

The custom-made miter bar fits snugly in your miter slot, ensuring that your measurements are as precise as a Swiss watch. No more wobbling around like a toddler on roller skates. This bar stays put, providing a stable base for your dial indicator.

## Real-World Application

The dial indicator allows you to measure the alignment of your blade to the miter slot with hair-splitting accuracy. Once aligned, you can be confident that your cuts will be as straight as an arrow.

### Router Table Adjustments

Adjusting your router table can be a real pain in the wood chips. The A-Line-It Deluxe Tool Kit makes it a breeze. Use the magnetic base to hold the dial indicator in place while you make precise adjustments to the height and alignment of your router bit. You'll get perfect joints and edges every time.

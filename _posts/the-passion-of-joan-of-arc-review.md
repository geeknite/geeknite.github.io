## The Plot (Spoiler Alert: She Dies)

The film tells the story of Joan of Arc's trial and execution, focusing on her intense spiritual journey and the cruel, unjust treatment she received from her inquisitors. Set in 1431, it's a heart-wrenching portrayal of faith, courage, and sacrifice.

The stark, minimalist set design adds to the film's emotional intensity, creating a sense of claustrophobia and hopelessness.

### Innovative Techniques

Dreyer employed groundbreaking techniques for the time, including low-angle shots, natural lighting, and unconventional framing. It's like he threw the rulebook out the window and said, "Let's make something that will blow people's minds for generations to come!" And boy, did he succeed.

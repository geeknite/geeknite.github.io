## Introduction

Hey Geeknite readers! Today's trip down memory lane features none other than the GoPro Hero5 Black. Released in 2016, this little action camera packed a punch and quickly became a favorite among adventurers and vloggers alike. Is it still worth picking up in 2025? Let's find out!

## Design and Build Quality

The GoPro Hero5 Black sports a sleek, minimalist design that's built to withstand some serious action. With a rubberized, rugged exterior, this camera can survive drops, bumps, and underwater escapades up to 10 meters without a housing. It's like the Swiss Army knife of cameras—versatile and nearly indestructible.

### Durability

Whether you're snowboarding down a mountain or diving into the ocean, the Hero5 Black is your trusty sidekick. Its waterproof build means you can take it virtually anywhere. And let's be honest, who doesn't want to film their dog swimming in slow motion?

## Video and Photo Quality

One of the standout features of the Hero5 Black is its ability to shoot in 4K at 30fps. For those who prefer a smoother frame rate, it also offers 1080p at 120fps—perfect for capturing those epic slow-motion shots of you failing at skateboarding.

### Image Stabilization

The built-in electronic image stabilization (EIS) helps smooth out the shakes and bumps, giving you a cleaner, more professional look. It's not perfect, but it's a lot better than strapping your smartphone to your helmet and hoping for the best.

## User Interface and Controls

The Hero5 Black features a 2-inch touchscreen on the back, making it easy to frame your shots and navigate through settings. Voice control is another handy feature, allowing you to command the camera to start recording or take a photo—useful when your hands are otherwise occupied.


### Connectivity

With built-in WiFi and Bluetooth, transferring your footage to your phone or computer is a breeze. The GoPro app provides a seamless way to edit and share your adventures, ensuring you're the envy of all your social media followers.

## Battery Life

Battery life is where the Hero5 Black shows its age. On a full charge, you can expect around 1.5 to 2 hours of continuous recording. It's not terrible, but if you're planning a full day of activities, carrying a spare battery or two is a must.

## Accessories

One of the best things about the GoPro ecosystem is the sheer number of accessories available. From mounts and cases to external microphones and lights, there's something for every scenario. Just be prepared to spend almost as much on accessories as you did on the camera itself.

## Price and Value

In 2025, the Hero5 Black can be found for a fraction of its original price, making it a budget-friendly option for those looking to get into action videography. While it may lack some of the bells and whistles of newer models, it still holds its own as a reliable, high-quality camera.

## Conclusion

The GoPro Hero5 Black may be a few years old, but it's still a fantastic choice for anyone looking to capture their adventures in stunning detail. Its durable build, impressive video quality, and user-friendly features make it a timeless classic in the world of action cameras. So, if you come across one at a good price, don't hesitate to grab it.

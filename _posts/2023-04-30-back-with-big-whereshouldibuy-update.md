Hi everyone!

I hope you are all doing well and enjoying the latest tech news and tips on geeknite.github.io. I know it's been a while since I posted anything new, and I want to apologize for that. I'm sure some of you are wondering what's going on and why I haven't been keeping up with the periodic articles.

Well, I have some exciting news to share with you. I've been working on a big update for [{{ site.constants.wsib }}]({{ site.constants.wsib }}), the website that helps you find the best deals on electronics online. You may remember that I wrote a blog post about it a few months ago, explaining how it works and why it's useful.

The update will make the website even better, faster, and more accurate. It will also add some new features that I think you will love. For example, you will be able to compare prices across different regions, currencies, and websites. You will also be able to filter your results by various criteria, such as brand, model, rating, reviews, etc. And you will be able to save your searches and get alerts when the prices change.

I'm really proud of this project and I can't wait to show it to you. But it's also taking a lot of time and effort to make it perfect. That's why I haven't been able to write new articles for geeknite.github.io lately. I hope you understand and forgive me for this temporary hiatus.

I promise that I will be back soon with more awesome content for you. In the meantime, you can still check out the previous articles on geeknite.github.io and leave your comments and feedback. I always appreciate hearing from you and learning from your opinions and suggestions.

Thank you for your support and patience. Stay tuned for the big update on [{{ site.constants.wsib }}]({{ site.constants.wsib }}). It's going to be amazing!

Cheers,
Your geeky friends

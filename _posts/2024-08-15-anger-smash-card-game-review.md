## Introduction

Welcome to the chaotic, hilarious, and downright addictive world of **AngerSmash**! This card game promises to test your patience, your friendships, and perhaps even your sanity. If you're looking for a game that combines strategy, humor, and a sprinkle of rage, then AngerSmash is the game for you. Strap in and get ready for a wild review of the most infuriatingly fun card game on the planet.

## The Basics of AngerSmash

AngerSmash is a competitive card game designed for 2-6 players. The goal? To smash your way to victory by reducing your opponents' confidence levels to zero while managing your own emotional rollercoaster. Think of it as "Uno" meets "Exploding Kittens" with a dash of "I swear I'm not mad" added to the mix. Each player starts with a hand of cards and a confidence level marker, and the last player standing wins.

### Components

AngerSmash comes with:
- **Confidence Marker**: A gauge of your emotional stability. Try not to let it hit rock bottom.
- **Deck of Cards**: Action cards, reaction cards, and event cards, each designed to either boost your confidence or smash your opponents'.
- **Humor**: Seriously, some card effects are so absurd you'll be laughing even as you lose.

**Fun Fact**: There's a card called "The Rage Quit" which lets you flip the table. Use it wisely.

## Gameplay

### Setup

Setting up AngerSmash is quick and easy. Shuffle the deck, distribute cards to each player, and set your confidence markers to maximum. Now, you're ready to dive into the madness.

### Playing the Game

Each turn, players draw a card and play one card from their hand. The played card can affect your confidence or that of your opponents. Some cards require immediate reactions, while others have lasting effects. The key is to manage your own confidence while strategically lowering your opponents'.

#### Turn Phases

1. **Draw Phase**: Draw a card from the deck.
2. **Play Phase**: Play a card from your hand.
3. **Reaction Phase**: React to any played cards if necessary.
4. **End Phase**: Check confidence levels and resolve any ongoing effects.

### Winning and Losing

To win, be the last player with any confidence left. If your confidence level hits zero, you're out and must perform a forfeit (like singing "I'm a Little Tea Pot"). The game continues until only one player remains.

**Pro Tip**: Keep an eye on the "Serenity Now" card. It may save your sanity when things get heated.

## AngerSmash: The Humor Factor

AngerSmash is packed with humor, from absurd card effects to hilarious forfeits. The game's light-hearted nature makes it fun even when you're losing, and the ridiculousness of some cards ensures that there's never a dull moment.

**Funny Moment**: During one game, a player used the "Instant Karma" card, causing their opponent to lose confidence every time they tried to sabotage. The laughter echoed for hours.

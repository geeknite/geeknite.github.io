## The Basics of Marvel Legends Captain Marvel

### What is a BAF Figure?

For those new to the world of action figures, a BAF or Build-A-Figure means you have to buy multiple figures to assemble one giant figure. Think of it like collecting Infinity Stones, but with less universal destruction and more display shelf satisfaction.

### Components

The Marvel Legends Captain Marvel BAF includes several interchangeable pieces and accessories:

- **Interchangeable Hands**: Because superheroes need wardrobe options too.
- **Photon Blasts**: For those epic battle poses.
- **Detailed Sculpt and Paint**: The level of detail will make you feel like you've plucked Carol Danvers right out of the comic pages.

The sculpting on this figure is nothing short of marvelous. From the intricate details on her suit to the expressive facial features, it's clear that the designers poured a lot of love into creating this figure. The paint job is equally impressive, with vibrant colors that pop and subtle shading that adds depth and realism.

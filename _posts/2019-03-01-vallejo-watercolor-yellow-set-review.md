## Comparison with Other Brands

How does Vallejo’s Watercolor Yellow Set fare against other popular brands like Winsor & Newton or Sennelier?

### Winsor & Newton

**Winsor & Newton** is another heavyweight in the watercolor world. While their yellows are robust, Vallejo’s pigments seem to hold a slight edge in vibrancy and smoothness.

### Sennelier

**Sennelier** offers creamy, honey-based watercolors that are a joy to work with, but Vallejo’s lightfastness and color consistency make it a strong competitor.

Hello Geeknite readers! Are you ready to dive into the world of wireless earbuds? Today, we're taking a close look at the Samsung Galaxy Buds Live, a pair of earbuds that look like little beans but promise to deliver big sound. Are these quirky earbuds worth your money, or should you stick to traditional designs? Grab your popcorn and read on to find out!

## Design and Comfort

### First Impressions

The first thing you notice about the Galaxy Buds Live is their unique design. Shaped like kidney beans, they certainly stand out from the crowd. Samsung has opted for a "less is more" approach, and it works beautifully. The earbuds come in three stylish colors: Mystic Bronze, Mystic White, and Mystic Black.

### Comfort Level

Despite their unusual shape, the Galaxy Buds Live are surprisingly comfortable. They fit snugly in the ear without causing discomfort, making them perfect for long listening sessions. The lack of silicone tips might be a downside for some, but the ergonomic design ensures they stay in place, even during vigorous activities.

## Sound Quality

### Audio Performance

Samsung has packed some serious audio tech into these tiny earbuds. The Galaxy Buds Live feature 12mm speakers with AKG tuning, resulting in rich, immersive sound. The bass is punchy, the mids are clear, and the highs are crisp. Whether you're blasting rock music or listening to a podcast, these earbuds deliver a fantastic audio experience.

### Active Noise Cancellation

One of the standout features of the Galaxy Buds Live is their active noise cancellation (ANC). While it might not rival the ANC found in over-ear headphones, it does a commendable job of reducing background noise. Perfect for when you want to escape the chaos of the outside world and immerse yourself in your music.

## Connectivity and Features

### Pairing and Connectivity

Pairing the Galaxy Buds Live with your device is a breeze. They connect via Bluetooth 5.0, ensuring a stable and fast connection. Whether you're using an Android or iOS device, the Galaxy Buds Live sync seamlessly, allowing you to enjoy your tunes without any hiccups.

### Touch Controls

The touch controls on the Galaxy Buds Live are intuitive and responsive. You can play/pause music, skip tracks, and answer calls with a simple tap. There's even a customizable touchpad, so you can set it up according to your preferences. However, be prepared for the occasional accidental touch – it's a small price to pay for convenience.

### Battery Life

Battery life is another area where the Galaxy Buds Live shine. They offer up to 8 hours of continuous playback, with an additional 21 hours provided by the charging case. Whether you're on a long-haul flight or a marathon listening session, these earbuds have you covered.

## Criticism and Funny Quirks

### The Bean Factor

Let's address the elephant (or should we say, bean) in the room: the design. While the bean shape is ergonomic, it might not be everyone's cup of tea. Some users have reported that they can't get over the "bean look" and feel self-conscious wearing them in public. But hey, if you love quirky designs, these earbuds are a conversation starter!

### Samsung's Usual Shenanigans

Samsung has a habit of throwing in features that you didn't know you needed until you have them. The Galaxy Buds Live are no different. From the Bixby voice assistant to "Find My Earbuds" functionality, these earbuds are packed with extras. Some might find these features unnecessary, but they add a layer of fun to the user experience.

## Final Recommendation

### Verdict

The Samsung Galaxy Buds Live are a solid choice for anyone looking to upgrade their wireless earbuds. Their unique design might be polarizing, but there's no denying their comfort, sound quality, and feature set. If you're a fan of Samsung's ecosystem and appreciate quirky, innovative designs, you won't be disappointed.

However, if you're looking for traditional earbuds with silicone tips and more robust noise cancellation, you might want to explore other options like the [Sony WF-1000XM4]({% post_url 2024-09-06-sony-wf-1000xm4-review %}) or the [Apple AirPods Pro]({% post_url 2025-05-18-apple-airpods-pro-review %}).

## Introduction

Hello Geeknite readers! Today, we're diving into the world of Kendama with the Play Pro Colorful Edition. Get ready to have your mind blown by this vibrant, challenging, and downright fun piece of Japanese artistry. Whether you're a seasoned Kendama player or a curious newbie, this review promises to be as entertaining as a cat video compilation. Let's get started!

## What is Kendama?

For those of you living under a rock (or perhaps just not obsessed with Japanese toys like we are), Kendama is a traditional Japanese skill toy consisting of a handle, called the ken, and a ball, called the tama, connected by a string. The goal is simple: perform tricks by catching the ball in the various cups on the ken or by landing it on the spike. Simple, yet maddeningly addictive!

## The Play Pro Colorful Edition

The Play Pro Colorful Edition takes this traditional toy and dials the fun up to 11. Available in a range of eye-popping colors, this edition is perfect for those who like their toys as vibrant as their personalities. Whether you go for neon green, electric blue, or fiery red, the Play Pro ensures you'll be catching eyes as well as tamas.

### Design and Build Quality

The first thing you'll notice about the Play Pro Colorful Edition is its striking design. The colors are bright and don't fade even after hours of intense play. The ken is made from high-quality beech wood, providing a sturdy and reliable feel. Plus, it can withstand those inevitable drops when you're attempting your 100th Lighthouse trick.

**Pros:**
- **Durable:** The beech wood construction is solid and can take a beating.
- **Eye-catching:** Vibrant colors that make a statement.
- **Smooth finish:** The paint job is top-notch, ensuring a smooth feel during play.

### Performance

When it comes to performance, the Play Pro Colorful Edition doesn't disappoint. The balance between the ken and tama is superb, making those tricky catches and balances just a bit easier. The string is durable, reducing the chance of those frustrating snaps mid-trick.

**Pros:**
- **Balance:** Excellent weight distribution for smooth play.
- **Durability:** Can handle rigorous play without wear and tear.
- **Grip:** The paint provides a good grip, essential for advanced tricks.

**Cons:**
- **String Length:** Some users might prefer a slightly longer string for certain tricks.

### Fun Factor

Now, let's talk fun. The Play Pro Colorful Edition is a joy to play with. The vibrant colors add an extra layer of excitement, and the smooth performance keeps you coming back for more. Whether you're just learning how to spike or you're a pro at the Swan, this Kendama is bound to keep you entertained.

**Pro Tip:** If you're new to Kendama, start with basic tricks like the 'Big Cup' and 'Small Cup' to get a feel for the balance and weight. Then, gradually move on to more complex tricks. Trust us, it's a journey worth taking!

### Comparison with Other Kendamas

While the Kendama USA Classic offers a more traditional look and feel, the Play Pro Colorful Edition stands out with its vibrant colors and slightly heavier weight. The Classic is great for those who appreciate the traditional design, but if you want to make a statement, the Play Pro is the way to go.

#### [Sweets Kendamas]({{ site.url }}/{{ page.url | remove: '.html' }}sweets-kendamas)

Sweets Kendamas are known for their high-quality craftsmanship and innovative designs. The Play Pro Colorful Edition holds its own against Sweets in terms of build quality and performance, though it may come down to personal preference when choosing between the two.

## Final Thoughts

The Kendama Play Pro Colorful Edition brings a burst of color and fun to the traditional Japanese skill toy. Its durable build, excellent balance, and vibrant design make it a great choice for both beginners and seasoned players. While it may be slightly heavier than other Kendamas, the added weight can actually help with control during tricky maneuvers.

## Introduction

Welcome, brave Hunters! Prepare to descend into the depths of **Bloodborne: The Boardgame - Chalice Dungeon**. If you thought the video game was intense, wait until you experience the tabletop version. This review will guide you through the dark corridors and monstrous challenges that await. Spoiler alert: there will be blood, sweat, and probably some cursing.

## What is Bloodborne: The Boardgame - Chalice Dungeon?

Bloodborne: The Boardgame - Chalice Dungeon is a cooperative board game based on the popular Bloodborne video game by FromSoftware. Players take on the roles of Hunters exploring procedural dungeons filled with terrifying monsters and challenging bosses. The game captures the dark, gothic atmosphere of the video game and translates it into a strategic tabletop experience.

- **Tiles**: Modular dungeon tiles that create a unique layout for each game.
- **Cards**: Action cards, enemy cards, and boss cards that dictate the flow of the game.
- **Tokens and Markers**: Used to track health, status effects, and other game elements.

So, gather your dice, prepare your spells, and let's see if this GM screen is as mighty as it claims to be!

## What's in the Box?

The Dragonbane GM Screen comes with:
- **A Tri-fold Screen**: Featuring stunning artwork and key tables on the back to make your GM duties easier.
- **Reference Sheets**: For quick access to rules and stats.
- **A Heartfelt Letter from a Dragon**: Just kidding. We wish.

First things first, the artwork on this GM Screen is absolutely breathtaking. Imagine a scene straight out of a high-fantasy epic, complete with dragons, castles, and brave adventurers. It's enough to make your players feel like they're stepping into another world. The artwork alone might make you want to buy this screen, even if you don't play the game!

### The Goodies

Behind the beautiful facade, the Dragonbane GM Screen is packed with useful tables and references. From combat rules to spell durations, everything you need to run a smooth game is right there.

## Setting Up

Setting up the Dragonbane GM Screen is as easy as pie. Simply unfold the screen, place it on your table, and you're ready to roll. There's no assembly required, which is great because, let's face it, we're not all IKEA experts.

## Gameplay Enhancement

### Shielding Secrets

One of the primary functions of any GM screen is to keep your notes, dice rolls, and evil plans hidden from your players. The Dragonbane GM Screen does this fabulously. It's tall and sturdy enough to block even the most curious player's prying eyes.

### Reference Tables

The back of the screen is a treasure trove of information. Need to check the damage of a dragon's fire breath? It's right there. Forgotten the rules for underwater combat? No problem. The reference tables are concise, well-organized, and incredibly useful. You might even start to wonder why you ever bothered with the rulebook in the first place.

## The Funny Bone

We all know that tabletop RPGs are as much about the laughs as they are about epic battles. The Dragonbane GM Screen doesn't disappoint in this department. The screen includes a few humorous touches that will make your game sessions even more enjoyable. For example, there's a section on "Situations You Should Never Get Into" with hilarious descriptions of what happens when players break the game. It's bound to get a chuckle or two.

### Example of Hilarity

During one session, my players decided to negotiate with a dragon using a "Compliment the Dragon's Scale Sheen" card from a humorous suggestion table. Needless to say, the dragon was flattered but not enough to spare their lives. The laughter that followed was priceless.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- **Useful References**: All the tables and charts you need to keep the game flowing smoothly.
- **Sturdy Construction**: This screen can withstand the most intense gaming sessions.
- **Humorous Touches**: Adds a bit of fun and levity to your game.

## Final Thoughts

The Dragonbane GM Screen is a fantastic addition to any Game Master's toolkit. Its combination of stunning artwork, useful references, and humorous touches makes it a must-have for anyone running Dragonbane or any other fantasy RPG. While it comes with a higher price tag, the quality and functionality justify the cost.

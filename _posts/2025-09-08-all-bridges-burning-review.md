## Introduction

Welcome back, Geeknite readers! Today, we’re diving into the chaos and intrigue of the Finnish Civil War with the historical strategy board game, **All Bridges Burning**. This game will have you plotting, scheming, and trying not to burn bridges with your friends. Buckle up, because this review is going to be as dramatic as the events it portrays!

## Overview

**All Bridges Burning** is a COIN (Counter-Insurgency) series game designed by **VPJ Arponen** and published by **GMT Games**. Set during the Finnish Civil War of 1918, players take on the roles of different factions vying for control, influence, and survival. It’s like being dropped into the middle of a historical soap opera, and trust us, it’s just as juicy.

## Gameplay

### Factions

The game features three factions: **Senate**, **Socialists**, and **Moderates**. Each faction has unique abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. You’ll be plotting coups, negotiating with enemies, and trying not to get caught in the crossfire. It’s like a political tug-of-war, but with more dramatic betrayals.

- **Senate**: Representing the government forces, they have the military might but are constantly fighting off insurgents. Think of them as the “law and order” faction.
- **Socialists**: The revolutionaries aiming to overthrow the Senate and implement socialist reforms. They’re like the rebellious teenagers of the game—loud, aggressive, and full of ambition.
- **Moderates**: The peacekeepers trying to negotiate and mediate between the Senate and Socialists. It’s like being the sensible adult in a room full of arguing children.

### Mechanics

**All Bridges Burning** employs the COIN series mechanics, which involve card-driven gameplay, operations, special activities, and events. This system ensures that every turn is filled with strategic decisions and high stakes. You’ll be manipulating resources, deploying forces, and trying to outmaneuver your opponents.

### Events

The event cards are where the real drama unfolds. Each card represents a historical event and can drastically change the game’s direction. From surprise attacks to diplomatic negotiations, these events add layers of complexity and unpredictability. It’s like watching a historical drama unfold before your eyes.

## Strategies and Tips

### Balancing Act

One key strategy is balancing offense and defense. Whether you’re the Senate trying to hold onto power or the Socialists plotting your next revolution, maintaining a balance is crucial. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket—or in this case, don’t put all your troops in one region.

### Negotiation Skills

For the Moderates, negotiation is your bread and butter. Utilize your ability to mediate and broker deals between warring factions. It’s like being a diplomat in the middle of a battlefield. Remember, a well-timed negotiation can be more powerful than a hundred soldiers.

### Adaptability

The unpredictable nature of event cards means you must be adaptable. One moment you’re on top, the next you’re scrambling to recover from a surprise attack. Stay flexible and be ready to change your strategy on the fly.

## Humor and Fun Factor

**All Bridges Burning** might be a game about war, but there’s plenty of room for humor. Whether it’s a dramatic betrayal that leaves everyone laughing, or a negotiation that goes hilariously wrong, the game is packed with memorable moments. Just remember, it’s all fun and games until someone loses Finland.

[Some days ago we could see how *Nokia* showed their next generation line up of smartphones, equipped with the new *Windows Phone 8*]({%- post_url 2012-06-09-Nokia-smartphones-with-Windows-Phone-8-It-will-really-be-a-change-or-a-step-close-to-the-edge -%}). And yesterday *Apple* presented the new version of their acclaimed phone, the **iPhone 5**. The main innovations are a larger screen and the addition of *4G* wireless technology. It is clear that the idea of this phone was to safeguard its lead over rivals like *Samsung* and *Google*, which some of their smartphones already have these functions.

**The *iPhone 5* fulfilled many of the expectations set by users and technology enthusiasts but offered few surprises to their followers**. All we saw was an evolution of last year's phone but analysts have predicted sales between 10 and 12 million of new iPhones this month.

*Apple* has opted to catch up with many of the features of current generation of *Android* smartphones, as *Samsung* and *Motorola* models already have smartphones with larger screens and *4G LTE* connection. You may guess that the main attraction of the device is the way the software and hardware work together, other people speculate that there will be something new in Apple's product portfolio before the start of the holiday season. During the presentation yesterday, the company did not reveal anything about the new Apple TV or the possibility of launching a smaller iPad.

The giant consumer electronics manufacturer that in 2010 popularized the tablet with their *iPad*, gave no clues as to whether they are planning a smaller version to compete with cheaper tablets of other companies like the *Google Nexus 7*, which soon I plan to post a review, or the recently announced *[Kindle Fire HD](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008GGCAVM/?tag={{ site.constants.amazon_com }}){: rel="nofollow"}* presented by *Amazon*.

On contrast of the *Nokia* presentation, **Apple's stock price rose 1.4% on Wednesday**, reaching $669.79.

We also may be alert as it seems that *Samsung*, as a revenge for their pantent war, **wants to block** the *iPhone 5* as they own some of the patents about the *4G LTE* technology, we will see in the following days.

Conclusions
-----------

This new phone can be useful for deal searchers, if you are an *Apple* fan you can get an *iPhone 4S* for much less and if you prefer an Android, probably the *Samsung Galaxy S3* can be found for a discounted price in the coming days. Be alert for offers! And share them if you found any deal!

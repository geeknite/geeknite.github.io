## What Are Force-Grown Drones?

Force-Grown Drones are the backbone of the W'adrhun armies in **Conquest: The Last Argument of Kings**. These bio-engineered warriors are created en masse to serve their masters in battle. Think of them as the sci-fi equivalent of disposable income – you can never have too many!

### The Basics

Force-Grown Drones come in units and are designed to swarm the battlefield, overwhelming enemies with sheer numbers. They may not be the brightest or the strongest, but they sure know how to put the "force" in Force-Grown.

## Components and Miniatures

### Quality and Design

The miniatures for Force-Grown Drones are stunningly detailed, with intricate designs that bring these bio-engineered horrors to life.

## Introduction

This cooperative board game will have you and your friends battling waves of undead monstrosities while trying not to get eaten alive. Get ready for a wild ride filled with strategy, laughter, and maybe a few screams!

## What is Zombicide: Green Horde?

Zombicide: Green Horde is part of the popular Zombicide series, where players team up to survive a zombie apocalypse. This edition introduces a new enemy: the Green Horde, a terrifying army of orcs-turned-zombies. It's a mix of fantasy, horror, and a lot of chaos.

### Components

The game comes with:
- **Miniatures**: Highly detailed miniatures of survivors and zombies. Seriously, they're so awesome you might want to display them on your mantle.
- **Cards**: Equipment, zombie spawn, and event cards that dictate the flow of the game.
- **Game Board**: Modular tiles that create different maps for each game, adding replayability.
- **Tokens and Markers**: Used to track objectives, survivor health, and various effects during gameplay.

**Pro Tip**: Keep the miniatures away from your dog; they are not chew toys.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up Zombicide: Green Horde is like preparing for a medieval siege. Arrange the modular tiles, distribute cards and miniatures, and select your survivors. Once everything is set, you're ready to face the green menace.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players choose actions for their survivors. You can move, attack, search for equipment, and more. Strategy is key, so plan your moves carefully to outwit the zombies.

### Combat

Combat in Zombicide: Green Horde is a blend of tactical planning and luck. You roll dice to determine the success of your attacks. Did you roll a critical hit just to miss the next attack? Welcome to Zombicide, where every roll counts.

## The Green Horde Awesomeness

### The Horde

The Green Horde brings a new level of challenge to the game. These orc zombies are tougher, faster, and meaner than your typical undead. The Horde mechanic allows zombies to accumulate and move as a group, creating intense moments of survival and teamwork.

**Funny Moment**: During one game, our team was so focused on fighting the Horde that we didn't notice a lone zombie sneaking up behind us. Needless to say, it was a hilarious (and slightly terrifying) surprise.

### Replayability

With modular tiles, various scenarios, and a plethora of equipment and zombie types, Zombicide: Green Horde offers endless replayability. No two games are ever the same, ensuring you'll return to face the Horde time and time again.

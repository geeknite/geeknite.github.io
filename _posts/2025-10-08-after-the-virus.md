## Introduction

Welcome, survivors, to the ultimate review of **After The Virus**! If you're a fan of strategy, zombies, and the occasional panic attack, this board game is for you. Let's dive into the gritty details of why this game is a must-have for your post-apocalyptic collection.

## The Premise

In **After The Virus**, you play as one of the few remaining humans trying to survive in a world overrun by zombies. Your goal? Complete objectives, fend off zombie hordes, and try not to lose your sanity in the process. It's like a fun family outing, but with more brain-eating monsters.

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Turn Phases

Each turn is divided into several phases:

1. **Action Phase**: Perform actions like moving, attacking, and using special abilities. You know, typical Tuesday stuff.
2. **Event Phase**: Draw event cards that introduce new challenges. Maybe more zombies, maybe a sudden need for toilet paper. Who knows?
3. **Zombie Phase**: Zombies move and attack. Cue the screaming.

### Objectives

To win, you must complete your objectives before the zombie invasion becomes too overwhelming. If you fail, it's game over, and humanity is doomed. No pressure.

## Characters

Each player takes on the role of a unique character, each with their own abilities and backstory.

### The Heroes

- **The Scientist**: Trying to find a cure, but mostly just making things explode.
- **The Exterminator**: Loves flamethrowers. A lot.
- **The Scout**: Sneaky and fast, like a caffeine-powered squirrel.
- **The Medic**: Always ready with a band-aid and a sarcastic remark.

One of the best aspects of **After The Virus** is its humor. From the ridiculous event cards to the over-the-top character abilities, there's never a dull moment. The game embraces the absurdity of a zombie apocalypse, and you'll find yourself laughing as much as strategizing.

**Funny Moment**: During one game, our Scientist tried to negotiate with a zombie using a "Peace Treaty" card. Spoiler: It didn't end well. The laughter echoed for hours.

## Gameplay Overview

### The Basics

**Deal with the Devil** is a game that pits players against each other in a race to make deals, fulfill contracts, and avoid eternal damnation. Think of it as a mix between Monopoly and a Faustian bargain, but with less property management and more soul-selling.

Players take on the roles of various characters, each with their own unique abilities and motivations. The goal is to complete objectives while either making or breaking deals with the devil himself. The twist? One player is secretly the devil, and they will do everything in their power to trick the others into making bad deals.

### Components

- **Board**: Beautifully designed, featuring intricate artwork that brings the dark and twisted world to life.
- **Cards**: A variety of cards, including contracts, abilities, and event cards that keep the gameplay dynamic and unpredictable.
- **Miniatures**: Detailed miniatures represent the characters, adding a tactile element to the game.
- **Tokens**: Various tokens to track deals, objectives, and players’ progress.

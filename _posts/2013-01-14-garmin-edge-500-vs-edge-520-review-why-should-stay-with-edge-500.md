[![Garmin edge 500](https://i.imgur.com/ZAlc9GQm.jpg){: .align-right}]({{ site.constants.wsib }}garmin edge 500)

First of all I want to make clear that my impression on the ***[Edge 520]({{ site.constants.wsib }}Garmin%20Edge%20520)*** is taken from the many reviews out there, I am not lucky enough for *Garmin* to send me one to review, and, of course, my *[Edge 500]({{ site.constants.wsib }}Garmin%20Edge%20500)* was bought with **my money**, I am not a renowned person in the bike world to get one for free as some do, I am just a **biking enthusiast** and this is just my impression of a product as a **humble biker**.

*Looking for modern alternatives? Check out our latest comparisons of the [Edge 530 vs 540]({% post_url 2023-12-23-garmin-edge-530-vs-540-comparison %}) or explore budget-friendly options like the [iGPSPORT BSC300T]({% post_url 2025-04-21-igpsport-bsc300t-review %}).*

In this post I want to share my point of view of how the*Edge 520* does not impress much on over the *Edge 500* owner and the reasons why **I will stay with my *Edge 500 *for the time being**. A device like this is perfect for not using your phone as a tracker, which probably has already a *GPS*,and also is a valid option, but as you may know its height accuracy is pretty bad. On the other hand the *Edge*series have a barometric altimeter which is perfect for this kind of tracking. Using an external *GPS tracker* is perfect for not overusing the battery of your phone and save it for emergencies.

*Here you can check the current prices and offers of the best Garmin GPS for bikers, the [Edge 500]({{ site.constants.wsib }}Edge%20500) (mine), the [Edge 510]({{ site.constants.wsib }}Edge%20510), the new [Edge 520]({{ site.constants.wsib }}Edge%20520), the [Edge 810]({{ site.constants.wsib }}Edge%20810) and the [Edge 1000]({{ site.constants.wsib }}Edge%201000) which are the top models from Garmin.*

### Size

The size I think it is the most important point on why I will stay with mine, the *Edge 500* is pretty much smaller than the *Edge 520*, which **is almost as big as the Edge 800**. The *Edge 500* is compact and has the perfect size for enough fields to check at riding time. I even use it as a **hiking *GPS***, I put it on the outer mesh pockets to get enough *GPS* signal reception and works just fine. The weight of the *Edge 520* has increased to 80g. when the *Edge 500*'s is just 58g.

### Screen

The touch screen seems nice and it is clearly **more user friendly**, counting it works good with gloves as they state. I don't know if it really has any real usefulness, here I lack enough information but **I am really doubtful on how this can improve the manipulation of the device and over all on riding conditions**. **The buttons on the *Edge 500* works exactly as they should**, they offer enough tactile information to know if you really pressed the buttons, and being on the side offer you the ability to keep your balance manipulating the device while you are on movement.

The color screen in the *Edge 520* is a nice touch but I don't think it is really needed, if they assure me it does not use more battery then it's okay, if not they should have stayed with the black and white one.

The *Edge 500* has a small reflection when found in direct sunlight but is not enough to not see the fields on the device, also the light is good for riding on dark situations. Also is recommendable to use a cheap cover to avoid wear on the unit.

### Connectivity

Of course connectivity possibilities have been much more improved, now being able to share through your mobile your ride information, with current social network addiction, many of us like to share our rides online as soon as possible. Until now, the *Edge 500*'s integration with services is good enough, due to these services improving and trying to make as easy as possible the user's experience, ***Strava* for example let you upload your ride in a couple of clicks**, also you can use *Garmin*'s service, **Garmin Connect**, and also you should check our [comparison of Strava vs Garmin Connect]({%- post_url 2013-09-30-strava-vs-garmin-connect-review-of-best-track-analyzers -%}). It's not instant but good enough for me. The connectivity with sensors and power meter remains the same, which was good enough. Perfect for use at home with your trainer, check our [Minoura B-60r review]({%- post_url 2013-01-12-minoura-b60-r-magnetic-trainer-review-best-for-money -%}), during winter.

### Software

The software is where the *Edge 520* should improve more over the *Edge 500*, as I have not tested the *Edge 520* I only can assume that it will improve the *Edge 500* capabilities. It has many new options **Strava integration being the most expected**, weather integration, fields depending on the profile, etc. **Many users have always been critic with the courses functionality on the *Edge 500***, maybe I am the only lucky one that got an *Edge 500* that worked more or less okay with courses, some minor error drawing in big courses but apart from that **it was even useful**, as I stated before **I also use it for hiking courses**. Another typical problem is the lack of refresh on some stats or the battery gauge hanged on 99%, but minor problems really that can be easily fixed.

The **Edge 520** probably will have bugs on its first weeks of life, but *Garmin* has enough time to improve the software on their device and introduce new features which we would love to see.

### Battery life

The *Garmin Edge 500* has an official battery duration of 18 hours, according to *Garmin*, I never experienced with the battery, so I would have to believe it as true. On the other hand the *Edge 520* has a duration of 20 hours, it seems the battery may have increased and probably the device is more battery efficient, but the two options are more than enough for a good ride.

### Price

I bought mine for around 200€ (around $240) at amazon in 2012, which was the complete package, with *HRM* strap and cadence sensor. The *Edge 520* has a price of $330 for the basic package. The increased price on the Edge 520 may cause some entry level enthusiasts to opt for other brands or the old model at a reduced price, and of course **to use the Strava integration you will need to pay the premium features which rise the price on 60€ per year**.

### Conclusions

With price:\
**Edge 500: 7.5**\
**Edge 520: 7**

Without considering the price:\
**Edge 500: 7.6**\
**Edge 520: 7.6**

So, taking into account the price, **it is really hard to beat the *Edge 500***, the *Edge 520*'s improvements have its drawbacks, it really don't make it advance the *Edge 500*.

The idea of this post was to give enough reasons to **stay with our *Edge 500*** or, if you have not any of the two devices, to get a small idea of the changes between the two generations.

But don't get me wrong, **the Edge 520 is a great device**, so, my recommendations depend on your situation:

- **If you are happy with your *Edge 500***: stick with it for a couple of years, at least, wait for other options and wait for how the *520* evolves or the new. Or the newest [Garmin 530]({% post_url 2022-12-28-garmin-edge-530-facts-consider-before-buying %}). Or even [the new and pricier Garmin Edge 540]({% post_url 2023-07-06-garmin-edge-540-review %})
- **If you have it but you want to improve your experience**: get an Edge 800 or [the Edge 810 vs the new Edge 1000]({% post_url 2014-07-29-garmin-edge-1000-vs-810-high-end-bike-gps-maps-routes %}).
- **If you don't have any of them**: with my points at hand, decide which can be better for you. **Look for offers on the *Edge 500 *or price reductions** if it gets below 180€ or $200 for the complete package can be a good deal. If you want the Edge 520 it may be a good option too even considering the increased price tag, or you can check for other *GPS* devices of other brands, which I am preparing a new post to do a small comparison of some of them.

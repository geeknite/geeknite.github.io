## Introduction

Welcome, miniatures painters and Warhammer enthusiasts! Today, we're delving into the deep, dark (and surprisingly soothing) world of **Citadel Shade: Drakenhof Nightshade**. This shade is infamous for transforming your miniatures from 'meh' to 'whoa' with just a few brush strokes. So, grab your brushes and let's get shady!

## The Shade That Rules the Night

### What is Drakenhof Nightshade?

Drakenhof Nightshade is a blue-black shade from Citadel Paints designed to add depth, shadows, and a touch of mystery to your miniatures. Whether you're shading space marines, elves, or random abstract sculptures you found in the attic, this shade is your go-to.

### Application

Applying Drakenhof Nightshade is as easy as pie (if pie were made of tiny, detailed plastic figures). Simply load your brush, apply liberally to the areas you want shaded, and watch in awe as the magic happens. The shade seeps into the recesses of your model, accentuating details and creating natural shadows.

**Pro Tip**: Use a clean brush to wick away any excess shade pooling in unwanted areas. It's like being a lifeguard for your miniatures.

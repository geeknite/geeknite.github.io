If you're looking to add some shadowy goodness to your models, this shade promises to give you all the depth and drama your miniatures deserve. Let's find out if Drakenhof Nightshade is worth the hype!

## What is Drakenhof Nightshade?

Drakenhof Nightshade is a dark blue shade from Citadel's range of paints, designed to enhance the details and recesses of your miniatures. Whether you're painting Space Marines, fantasy warriors, or even your grandmother's porcelain cat collection, this shade is versatile enough to handle it all.

### The Basics

## Application

### How to Apply

Using Drakenhof Nightshade is like applying magical shadows to your miniatures. Here’s a quick guide on how to use it effectively:

1. **Prime Your Model**: Make sure your model is properly primed. White or grey primers work best to bring out the shade's depth.
2. **Base Coat**: Apply your base colors before shading. This helps the shade settle into recesses and create contrast.
3. **Shade on**: Brush Drakenhof Nightshade generously onto your model, letting it flow into the crevices and details. Avoid pooling by spreading it evenly.
4. **Dry Time**: Let it dry thoroughly. You don't want smudges or finger marks ruining your masterpiece.
5. **Highlight**: Once dry, you can add highlights to enhance the contrast and make your model pop.

### Pros and Cons

#### Pros

## Comparison with Other Shades

### Nuln Oil

While Drakenhof Nightshade offers a rich blue tone, [Nuln Oil](https://example.com/nuln-oil) is the go-to black shade loved by miniature painters everywhere. It provides excellent shading but lacks the unique color depth Drakenhof Nightshade offers.

### Agrax Earthshade

[Agrax Earthshade](https://example.com/agrax-earthshade) is perfect for a warmer, brownish tone. It's great for earthy or rustic models but doesn't have the cool shadowy effect of Drakenhof Nightshade.

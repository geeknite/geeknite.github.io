### First Impressions: A Love-Hate Relationship with the Galaxy Nexus

I received the **Samsung Galaxy Nexus** ([check price on Amazon](https://www.amazon.es/?_encoding=UTF8&tag={{ site.constants.amazon_es }}&linkCode=ur2&camp=3626&creative=24822)) about an hour ago. These are my first impressions, and I will add to the review as I become more accustomed to the phone.

### Setup: Easy or a Puzzle?

Upgrading from my old HTC/Google Nexus was straightforward. All I needed to do was:
1. Take the SIM out of the old phone.
2. Snap the back off the Galaxy Nexus (a bit fiddly, but manageable).
3. Install the SIM and battery, refit the back cover, and power it up.

The phone immediately began installing apps I had set to auto-update on my old phone. Within minutes, it prompted me for a firmware update, which took about 3 minutes, including a reboot. So far, so good!

### The Screen: Gorgeous but Distracting

The **4.65-inch AMOLED screen** is stunning—vibrant, large, and easy to read. However, the **Ice Cream Sandwich UI** introduces a sideways swipe for the app tray instead of the traditional up/down gesture. Muscle memory betrayed me multiple times in the first hour. Thanks, Google, for the unannounced finger gymnastics!

### Camera: Great Quality, but Watch Your Fingers!

Taking photos and videos is straightforward, and the quality is impressive. However, I kept accidentally covering the microphone while filming. Pro tip: Learn how to hold your phone properly unless you want your videos to sound like they were recorded underwater.

### Updates and Features: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly

#### 2 Hours In:
- The **Portable WiFi Hotspot** worked flawlessly, connecting my iPad 2 to the internet.
- Bluetooth pairing with my car's hands-free system was seamless.

#### 6 Hours In:
- Photos and videos are sharp, but focusing can be tricky. Tap the screen to focus on your subject—unless you're in camcorder mode, where tapping captures a still instead. Confusing? Yes. Useful? Sometimes.

#### 3 Days In:
- Battery life is decent: 20 hours of normal use (mostly data access) with 34% remaining.
- The **auto-dimming screen brightness** is too low for my taste. Adjusting it manually is a must.

#### 5 Days In:
- The phone crashed twice and froze once. Stability issues? Definitely. But hey, it's Android—updates might fix it... eventually.
- Flash support was missing initially, but Adobe later rolled out a fix. Apps like BBC iPlayer now work, but some apps still lack Android 4 compatibility.

### Ubuntu OS: A Brave New World?

Fast forward to 2013, and **Ubuntu OS** released a beta version for the Galaxy Nexus. Intrigued, I decided to give it a try. Spoiler alert: It's a mixed bag. While the concept is exciting, the execution feels half-baked. If you're a tech enthusiast, it might be worth experimenting with. For everyone else? Stick to Android.

### Final Thoughts: Should You Buy the Galaxy Nexus?

The Galaxy Nexus is a solid phone with a few quirks. If you're looking for a budget-friendly device to experiment with Ubuntu OS or just want a reliable Android phone, it's worth considering. Check the latest prices on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.es/?_encoding=UTF8&tag={{ site.constants.amazon_es }}&linkCode=ur2&camp=3626&creative=24822).

**Rating:** 4/5  
**Verdict:** Great for tech enthusiasts, but casual users might find the quirks frustrating.

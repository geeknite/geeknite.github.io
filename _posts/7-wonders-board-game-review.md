## Introduction

Welcome, fellow board game enthusiasts and strategy lovers! Today, we are diving into the ancient world of **7 Wonders**. If you're a fan of civilization-building games and appreciate a good blend of strategy and resource management, then this game might just be the wonder you've been looking for. Prepare for a journey through historical civilizations, architectural marvels, and more strategy than you can shake a pyramid at.

## The Basics

### What is 7 Wonders?

**7 Wonders** is a card drafting and strategy game designed by Antoine Bauza and published by Repos Production. Players take on the roles of leaders of ancient civilizations, guiding them through three ages of development, building wonders, structures, and advancing their military might. The game accommodates 2-7 players and takes about 30-45 minutes to play—perfect for those who enjoy deep strategy without an all-nighter.

### Components

The game comes with:
- **Wonder Boards**: Representing the seven wonders of the ancient world.
- **Cards**: For resources, buildings, and wonders.
- **Tokens and Coins**: To keep track of resources, military victories, and treasury.
- **Rulebook**: Clear and concise, though you might need a Rosetta Stone to decipher some strategies.

**Pro Tip**: Keep an eye on your neighbors. Their resources can affect your strategy more than you think. Also, don't eat the tokens—they're not as delicious as they look.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up **7 Wonders** feels like opening an ancient tome. Lay out the wonder boards, shuffle the cards by age, and distribute starting resources. Each player gets a wonder board and a hand of cards to start drafting.

### Turns and Actions

Each age consists of players drafting cards from their hands, playing them to build structures, gather resources, or advance their military. Cards are played simultaneously, adding a layer of suspense and strategy. Will your neighbor build a library or a barracks? Only time will tell.

### Scoring

Scoring in **7 Wonders** is as intricate as ancient hieroglyphics. Points are awarded for buildings, wonders, military victories, scientific achievements, and treasury. The player with the most points at the end of three ages wins the game and eternal bragging rights.

## The Strategy

### Building Wonders

The wonders are not just for show—they provide significant advantages. Each wonder offers unique benefits and requires specific resources to build. Prioritizing wonder construction can set you up for victory.

**Pro Tip**: Don't neglect scientific buildings. They might seem like a slow burn, but their exponential scoring can lead to a late-game comeback.

### Resource Management

Balancing resource production and trade is crucial. You'll need wood, stone, clay, and more to construct your empire. Trade with neighbors wisely, and don't be afraid to spend a bit to gain a lot.

**Funny Moment**: In one game, a player forgot to gather enough clay and ended up trying to build a wonder with imaginary bricks. The laughter was as monumental as the Great Pyramid.

### Military Might

Military conflicts occur at the end of each age. Compare the military strength with your neighbors to gain victory points. But beware, over-investing in the military can leave you resource-poor.

**Criticism Alert**: Military conflicts can feel a bit punitive, especially if you're sandwiched between aggressive neighbors. It's like being stuck between a rock and a hard place, with the rock having a sword.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- **Engaging Gameplay**: Deep strategy and card drafting keep players engaged.
- **High Replayability**: Variable setups and strategies ensure no two games are the same.
- **Beautiful Components**: The artwork and design are top-notch.
- **Quick Playtime**: Perfect for a game night without monopolizing your evening.

### Cons

- **Learning Curve**: New players might find the strategy and scoring complex.
- **Player Interaction**: Limited direct interaction beyond military conflicts.
- **Component Management**: The abundance of cards and tokens can be fiddly.

## Final Thoughts

**7 Wonders** is a fantastic addition to any board game collection, especially for those who enjoy strategy and civilization-building. Its engaging gameplay, high replayability, and beautiful components make it a must-have. While it may have a learning curve, the rewarding experience it offers is well worth the effort.

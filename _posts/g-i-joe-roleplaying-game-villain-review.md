## Introduction

Yo Joe! Or should I say, Yo Cobra! Today, we're diving headfirst into the treacherous and sinister world of the **G.I. Joe Roleplaying Game Villain Expansion**. If you're a fan of the classic G.I. Joe series and love roleplaying games, this expansion is bound to make you yell, "Cobra-la-la-la-la-la!"

But why take my word for it? Strap in, soldier, because we're about to embark on a hilarious and action-packed mission to review this game.

## What is the G.I. Joe Roleplaying Game Villain Expansion?

The G.I. Joe Roleplaying Game Villain Expansion is an add-on to the base game, introducing a host of new villains, missions, and mechanics. It allows players to step into the shoes of Cobra agents and take on the daring Joes in a bid to conquer the world. Think of it as your chance to be the bad guy without getting thrown in the brig.

### The Basics

In this expansion, players can choose from a variety of iconic Cobra villains, each with their own unique abilities and schemes. The goal is to complete villainous missions, thwart the Joes, and assert your dominance as the ultimate Cobra commander.

### Components

The expansion comes with:

- **Villain Miniatures**: Beautifully crafted miniatures of your favorite Cobra villains. These are so detailed, you might feel an evil laugh bubbling up.
- **Mission Cards**: New missions that test your cunning and treachery.
- **Game Board**: Additional locations for your villainous activities.
- **Tokens and Markers**: Used to track progress, health, and various effects during the game.

**Pro Tip**: Keep your household pets away from the miniatures. They might mistake Cobra Commander for a chew toy.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up the G.I. Joe Roleplaying Game Villain Expansion is akin to planning a covert operation. Lay out the game board, distribute villain miniatures and mission cards, and choose your schemes. Now you're ready to begin your devious quest.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players draw cards and take actions based on their villain's abilities. You can launch attacks, sabotage the Joes, and execute nefarious plans. Strategy and chaos go hand in hand, so plan wisely (or not, I'm not your boss).

### Combat

Combat in the G.I. Joe Roleplaying Game Villain Expansion is a mix of strategy and hilarity. Each villain has unique mechanics that add new challenges and twists to the game.

2. **Low Resolution**: The screens have a resolution of 256x192 pixels, which is quite low by today's standards. It's like watching a modern movie on a VHS tape.
3. **Limited Storage**: There's no internal storage, so you'll need to rely on game cartridges. Hardcore collectors might need a separate suitcase just for games.

## What's in the Box?

Opening this pack feels like unwrapping a Christmas present from that eccentric uncle who travels the world. Inside, you'll find:

- **New Maps**: Six brand new maps that will make your zoo management even more challenging and fun.
- **Rulebook**: A beautifully illustrated rulebook that's almost as exciting to read as your favorite comic book.
- **Tokens**: A set of new tokens to add more chaos to your game (because who doesn't love a good challenge?).

## The New Maps

### Map 1: The Jurassic Park Wannabe

Ever wondered what it's like to house dinosaurs in a modern zoo? Well, Map 1 is here to scratch that itch. It's all fun and games until a T-Rex decides to go on a rampage. Just kidding, there are no real dinosaurs, but the challenges are colossal!

### Map 2: The Aquatic Adventure

Dive into the deep blue with Map 2. Managing aquatic animals brings a splash of new strategies to the table. Just make sure your sharks don't escape, or you might need a bigger boat (or a bigger sense of humor).

### Map 3: The High-Tech Haven

Welcome to the future! Map 3 is all about integrating cutting-edge technology into your zoo. Think robo-keepers and holographic displays. Just pray the robots don't develop a mind of their own.

### Map 4: The Jungle Madness

Get ready to channel your inner Tarzan. Map 4 transforms your zoo into a dense jungle, complete with hidden paths and wild vines. Swing from tree to tree as you try to keep everything under control.

### Map 5: The Arctic Escape

Brrr! Map 5 brings the chill of the Arctic to your zoo. Managing polar bears and penguins in a frozen landscape is no walk in the park. Remember to keep your visitors warm, or they might turn into popsicles.

### Map 6: The Galactic Zoo

Houston, we have a zoo! Map 6 takes your zoo management skills to outer space. With alien animals and zero-gravity enclosures, this map is out of this world. Just watch out for UFOs abducting your prized exhibits.

## Gameplay Experience

Playing with the new maps adds layers upon layers of strategy and hilarity to *Ark Nova*. Each map forces you to adapt and think outside the box. Whether you're trying to prevent a robotic uprising or ensuring your space penguins don't float away, you'll be laughing (and maybe crying) through every twist and turn.

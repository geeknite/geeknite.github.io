We are starting to promote WM and yet still not has much audience, we will start today talking the first steps to prepare your wishlist for start tracking your products.<br /><br /><h3>Installing</h3><ol><li><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dGahNCFFnOU/UVVvpgN8MlI/AAAAAAAAARQ/xzFqniFc9yw/s1600/Application+Install+-+Security+Warning.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="120" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dGahNCFFnOU/UVVvpgN8MlI/AAAAAAAAARQ/xzFqniFc9yw/s200/Application+Install+-+Security+Warning.jpg" width="200" /></a></div>Install WM, go to <a href="https://wmhomepage.apphb.com/" rel="nofollow">the homepage</a>&nbsp;or click the right pane download button which directly links the installer. The <i>Clickonce</i> installer will popup a windows alert asking to install the app, it will alert you that app downloaded from the internet are dangerous but as you may realize it does not ask for special permissions (if you have the permissions demand of Windows 7 (<i>UAC</i>) activated). You can proceed to install.</li><br /><li><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-j07PZ4GDD8U/UVVwmQqmpdI/AAAAAAAAARY/JzoiUTGH82g/s1600/(10%25)+Installing+WM.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="installation progress" border="0" height="107" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-j07PZ4GDD8U/UVVwmQqmpdI/AAAAAAAAARY/JzoiUTGH82g/s200/(10%25)+Installing+WM.jpg" title="" width="200" /></a>Wait for the installer to download the app files, it's only a few MB and with fast connections it is a short wait. You can cancel the process any moment but it is just a simple app that can be easily uninstalled later if you are not happy, and remember that <b>if you find any problems in the install process we can help you, just leave us a comment</b>.</li><br /><div><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lMTiA9WCq1g/UVVzFmqSJ9I/AAAAAAAAARo/Ksw-eCHIF1Q/s1600/PrtScr+capture.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="desktop icon" border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lMTiA9WCq1g/UVVzFmqSJ9I/AAAAAAAAARo/Ksw-eCHIF1Q/s1600/PrtScr+capture.jpg" title="" /></a></div><li><b>After the install process the program will auto-launch</b>, the install process will create an icon on your desktop and your start menu, you can delete the desktop one if you have a desktop extremely organized. Remember that you can uninstall easily the app at&nbsp;<i>programs and features</i>, just search the <b>WM</b>&nbsp;entry.</li></ol><h3>Creating your wishlist</h3><ol> <div><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oQ7TUtsptvc/UVV0GpL1cjI/AAAAAAAAAR0/kHsrNm50eZw/s1600/PrtScr+capture_2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="add product to wishlist" border="0" height="50" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oQ7TUtsptvc/UVV0GpL1cjI/AAAAAAAAAR0/kHsrNm50eZw/s200/PrtScr+capture_2.jpg" title="" width="200" /></a></div><li>The program will start with an empty wishlist so you will need to import the items you want to track. <b>Click the '+' icon and a text box area will open, there you will have to put the&nbsp;URL</b>&nbsp;(or address) of the amazon product, that item will be added to your wishlist in <b>WM</b>.</li><br /><li><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DylKgiLllCw/UVXhb5fG2NI/AAAAAAAAASQ/KwDEbQMxrh4/s1600/WM_2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="104" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DylKgiLllCw/UVXhb5fG2NI/AAAAAAAAASQ/KwDEbQMxrh4/s200/WM_2.jpg" width="200" /></a></div>If the product is already being tracked by our <i>cloud</i>&nbsp;server you will get a new entry in your wishlist with the current info, which includes the name, price, image and a <b>graph of the price evolution since it started being tracked by our servers</b>. The graph by default is hidden you have to press the second button in the product to see it. The price is <i>localized </i>in the currency of the amazon which the item belongs and the desired price is 1 cent minus the price in the moment of adding it to your wishlist, in incoming versions we will be able to edit the desired price. <b>The button with the "a" opens a new webpage to the product on amazon in your default browser</b>&nbsp;and the bin deletes the item from your wishlist.</li><br /><li><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7_KUc39ozTA/UVXi0hnw3UI/AAAAAAAAASY/LhZ6tpvaNs8/s1600/WM_3.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="45" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7_KUc39ozTA/UVXi0hnw3UI/AAAAAAAAASY/LhZ6tpvaNs8/s200/WM_3.jpg" width="200" /></a></div>In the other hand, if the product is not registered in our servers you will get a blank item pending to being tracked by our server, <b>our server will register the item to start tracking it from now on,</b> so, on the next hours you will get the item with all the data.</li><br /><li><div><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eArMENJlsdU/UVX7L9VuzzI/AAAAAAAAATE/oRMOLyGnwrM/s1600/Wish+List.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="153" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eArMENJlsdU/UVX7L9VuzzI/AAAAAAAAATE/oRMOLyGnwrM/s200/Wish+List.jpg" width="200" /></a></div><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7PrEstwxmPM/UVX7L69od-I/AAAAAAAAATA/zSFTpgr3BH4/s1600/Wish+List+2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="120" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7PrEstwxmPM/UVX7L69od-I/AAAAAAAAATA/zSFTpgr3BH4/s200/Wish+List+2.jpg" width="200" /></a>You have to be careful when you get the URL from the address bar in your navigator, the URL has an identifier for the product, and with products that have different sizes, like a t-shirt, every size has its own identifier and therefore its own URL, <b>the problem is that&nbsp;when you chose the size the address bar does not updates to the selected size</b>, so the less annoying way to deal with this is to add the product to your wishlist, as we added a new function in the last version to import complete amazon wishlists.  After adding the item to your wishlist you have to make your wishlist public through the "Change" button in your wishlist (<i>see image</i>), it is only needed to share with the link, then you will have to get the link in the "Share with friends" button (see the other image"). </li></ol><h4></h4><h4><br /></h4><h4>On privacy</h4>As you may have noticed we don't ask for user, nor registers, nor emails, we also don't save the items that you request info for, nor your wishlist, so you can rest assured for your privacy. The items on your wishlist are stored on your own computer.

## Introduction

Hey, fellow mist dwellers! Ready to dive into the smoky, noir world of **City of Mist: Fortune Row**? If you're into gritty detective stories, supernatural mysteries, and roleplaying games that make you feel like you're in a Raymond Chandler novel (but with more tentacles), then buckle up, because this review is about to take you on a wild ride.

## What is City of Mist: Fortune Row?

City of Mist: Fortune Row is a roleplaying game set in a city where legends and myths come to life. Players take on the roles of ordinary people who have been imbued with extraordinary powers, thanks to their connection with mythical entities. Think of it as "CSI meets Neil Gaiman's American Gods," but with more sass and less lab coats.

### The Basics

In City of Mist: Fortune Row, you'll be solving mysteries, battling supernatural foes, and uncovering the secrets of the city. Each player controls a character with unique abilities and a deep, personal story. The game is driven by narrative rather than numbers, focusing on character development and storytelling.

### Components

The game includes:

- **Character Sheets**: Detailed sheets to track your character's abilities, story, and progress.
- **Deck of Mysteries**: A set of cards to inspire and guide your investigations.
- **Game Master Guide**: A comprehensive guide for the GM to create immersive and engaging stories.
- **Dice**: Because what's a roleplaying game without dice to curse at when they betray you?

**Pro Tip**: Keep a magnifying glass handy. Not for the clues, but to admire the stunning artwork on the cards.

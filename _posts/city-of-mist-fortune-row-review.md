## Gameplay Mechanics

### Narrative Focus

City of Mist is heavily narrative-driven. It emphasizes storytelling and character development over complex dice mechanics. If you love weaving intricate tales and diving into character backstories, this game is for you.

### Moves and Tags

The game uses a unique system of 'Moves' and 'Tags' to resolve actions. Instead of rolling for every little thing, players describe their actions and apply relevant tags to influence the outcome. It's like a storytelling version of Mad Libs, but with more crime and less grammar.

### Cinematic Feel

The game aims to emulate the feel of a TV series or movie. Scenes are structured to flow seamlessly from one to another, ensuring the story remains engaging and dynamic. If you've ever wanted to direct your own noir film, now's your chance.

## The Setting

### Fortune Row

Fortune Row is a district in the City of Mist teeming with intrigue, danger, and secrets. The starter campaign introduces players to its colorful inhabitants and shady dealings. It's the perfect backdrop for tales of heroism, betrayal, and everything in between.

## Characters

The pre-generated characters in Fortune Row are as diverse as they are interesting. Whether you're playing a hard-boiled detective with a tragic past or a mythical being trying to blend in, there's something here for everyone.

### Notable Pre-Gens

- **Detective Doyle**: A classic gumshoe who can talk to the dead. Just don't ask him about his love life.
- **Vivian Vale**: An ex-con with the power of Medusa. She has a stony glare that can literally petrify you.
- **Rocco Rizzo**: A jazz musician with the charm of Apollo. He can soothe souls and manipulate emotions with his music.

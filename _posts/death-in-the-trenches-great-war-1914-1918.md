### Daily Life

Daily life in the trenches was a mix of boredom and terror. Soldiers spent most of their time trying to stay dry and avoid becoming a snack for the local rodent population. When they weren't dodging bullets, they were writing letters home, playing cards, or trying to score some extra rations. The camaraderie among the soldiers is one of the book's highlights. Despite the dire circumstances, they managed to find moments of laughter and friendship.

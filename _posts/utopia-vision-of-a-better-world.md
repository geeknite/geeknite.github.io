## The Concept of Utopia

### What is Utopia?

Before we delve into the art card itself, let's talk about utopia. The term 'utopia' was coined by Sir Thomas More in his 1516 book, which depicts a fictional island society with a perfect socio-politico-legal system. It's the stuff dreams are made of—a world free from poverty, injustice, and the daily grind. If only we could all live in a utopia, but let's be real, where's the fun in perfection?

### Utopian Art

Utopian art aims to capture these idealistic visions, presenting a world as it should be rather than as it is.

After a few months of rigorous testing (including several impromptu dance sessions), it still looks as good as new. Bravo, Afghan rug makers, bravo.

### Maintenance

Cleaning this rug is a breeze. Regular vacuuming keeps it looking fresh and fabulous. And if you spill your coffee during your morning existential crisis, fear not! A quick blot with a damp cloth does the trick. It's like having a guardian angel for your floor.

### Components

The game comes with beautifully illustrated cards that depict various elements of a utopian society, such as **Peaceful Gardens**, **Innovative Technologies**, and **Hilarious Politicians**. The components also include a rulebook that might be slightly more complex than you'd expect but hey, it's all part of the fun!

**Fun Fact**: The game includes a special "Chaos Card" that will make you question every strategic decision you've ever made.

## The Basics

### What is Zombicide: Special Guest - Edouard Guiton?

Zombicide is a cooperative board game where players team up to survive waves of zombie attacks while completing objectives. The Special Guest edition features miniatures designed by Edouard Guiton, bringing his unique artistic style to the game. Each miniature is intricately detailed, making them perfect for display or gameplay.

### Components

The special guest edition includes:

- **Miniatures**: Beautifully crafted miniatures of characters and zombies designed by Edouard Guiton.
- **Cards**: Character cards that detail abilities and stats.
- **Game Tiles**: Various locations where the zombie apocalypse unfolds.
- **Tokens and Markers**: Used to track progress, health, and effects during the game.

**Pro Tip**: Don't let your cat near the miniatures. Those claws are the real supervillains.

## Introduction: The Evolution of Cycling Board Games



---

## The Core Game

Before we get into the nitty-gritty of the Grand Tour expansion, let’s take a quick refresher on what makes Flamme Rouge such a beloved game. Flamme Rouge is a fast-paced bicycle racing game where players control a team of two cyclists, a Rouleur and a Sprinteur, each with their unique deck of movement cards. The objective is to manage your energy wisely and cross the finish line first. But don’t get too cocky—pacing is key, and running out of steam is easier than you think.

**Pro Tip:** Energy management in Flamme Rouge mirrors real cycling strategy—always save something for the final sprint, because there's nothing worse than watching opponents surge past while you're stuck with exhaustion cards.

## Grand Tour Expansion: What’s New?

The Grand Tour expansion introduces multi-stage racing, providing players with a series of interconnected races that form a longer, more immersive campaign. This format mimics the experience of real-world cycling tours, adding depth and ongoing strategy from stage to stage.

### New Tracks

Grand Tour includes new, beautifully designed tracks that offer various terrain types and strategic challenges. Hills, flat stages, and treacherous mountain passes make every race unique and force players to adapt their strategies continuously.

### Stages and Strategy

Each stage of the Grand Tour affects the next. Performance in one stage can provide advantages or disadvantages in subsequent races, such as carrying over exhaustion cards or earning extra energy tokens. This adds a layer of long-term planning that wasn’t present in the base game.

**Pro Tip:** Think beyond the current race. Sacrificing a stage win to conserve energy for future stages can be a winning strategy.

## The Flavor of Flamme Rouge: Grand Tour

One of the best aspects of Flamme Rouge is how it balances strategy with fun. The game’s mechanics are solid, but it’s the little moments—like when you perfectly draft behind another cyclist or completely miscalculate your energy—that make it memorable.

**Funny Moment:** During one game, a player miscalculated their movement and ended up stuck behind a slower cyclist for half the race. The resulting frustration was only matched by the laughter from everyone else at the table.

**Pro Tip:** Use the announcer voice for extra flair. “And coming around the final bend, it’s... oh no, they’ve hit an exhaustion card!”

When it comes to comfort, the Colleen Slate Geometric Pattern Area Rug truly shines. With its plush texture, it provides a cozy feel underfoot that’s perfect for lounging, playing, or simply walking around barefoot pretending you're in a carpet commercial.

### **Cleaning Tips**

- **Regular Vacuuming**: Use a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment to remove dirt and debris. Avoid using a high-powered vacuum that might damage the fibers.

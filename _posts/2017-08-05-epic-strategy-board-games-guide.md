## Age of Conan: The Strategy Board Game - Conquer the Hyborian Age

### Game Overview

**Age of Conan: The Strategy Board Game** transports players to Robert E. Howard's legendary Hyborian Age. Designed by Francesco Nepitello, Marco Maggi, and Roberto Di Meglio, this game was published by Fantasy Flight Games and puts 2-4 players in control of mighty kingdoms vying for dominance.

#### Historical Context
Robert E. Howard created Conan the Barbarian in 1932, setting his stories in the fictional Hyborian Age occurring after Atlantis fell but before recorded history. The board game captures this rich fantasy setting with remarkable detail.

### The Four Kingdoms

Players command one of four distinct civilizations:

**Aquilonia** - The most civilized kingdom, inspired by medieval Europe
- Strong in diplomacy and politics
- Access to advanced military units
- Powerful late-game potential

**Turan** - The eastern empire, based on historical Turkic peoples  
- Excellent cavalry and mobility
- Strong economic base
- Aggressive expansion capabilities

**Stygia** - The mysterious southern kingdom, inspired by ancient Egypt
- Powerful sorcery and dark magic
- Unique quest opportunities  
- Defensive advantages

**Hyperborea** - The harsh northern realm
- Resilient warriors and tough units
- Winter survival advantages
- Resource management focus

### Core Gameplay Mechanics

#### Strategy Phase
- Draw and play strategy cards
- Plan diplomatic actions
- Set military objectives

#### Action Phase  
- Move armies across the detailed map
- Engage in tactical combat
- Execute political maneuvers
- Launch economic initiatives

#### Adventure Phase
- Send heroes on dangerous quests
- Discover ancient artifacts
- Gain magical abilities and treasures
- Influence Conan's movements across the board

> **Pro Tip:** Master the adventure system early - controlling powerful artifacts can shift the entire balance of power in your favor!

### Unique Features

**The Conan Factor:** The legendary barbarian moves independently across the board, creating opportunities and chaos wherever he goes. Players can influence but never fully control this wild card element.

**Quest System:** Heroes embark on dangerous missions to gain powerful rewards. Success requires careful resource management and risk assessment.

**Political Intrigue:** Diplomacy is crucial - temporary alliances can mean survival, but trust is always temporary in the Hyborian Age.

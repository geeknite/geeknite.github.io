Longer, lower and slacker, modern bikes are all set with this parameters in mind, but all these geometry parameters also can be altered with components and offset bushings are a clever way to do it. Bushings are components that connects the rear shock with your frame, simplifying it's a support with a hole for the bushing nut to screw on, bushing usually have the hole in the center, but offset bushing have a small offset so the hole is not in the center, this allows us to mount the shock giving extra length or removing some length, depending on how we mount the bushings.

[Offset bushings cost £14.40 each](https://www.offsetbushings.com/collections/all/products/offset-bushing), but you will probably need a DU bush tool to ease the installation procedure, which costs £12. If you get a pair plus the tool will cost £40.80 plus shipping, free in the UK, £4 outside the UK. Everything for around 48€.

I don't have direct experience with offset bushings in my bikes, but just installed a pair in a clients bike, and the idea is so good, taking into account modern bikes that allow 29, plus or 27.5 wheels they can allow us a way of tuning the bottom bracket height and the angles so we can adjust the bike to our preferences. Check our [definitive plus tire mountain bike list]({%- post_url 2017-02-21-the-definitive-plus-tire-mountain-bike-list -%}) for bikes that offer these possibilities.

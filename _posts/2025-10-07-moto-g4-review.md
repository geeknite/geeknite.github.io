Hello, Geeknite readers! Today, we're diving into the world of budget smartphones with the Moto G4. This affordable device promises to deliver a solid performance without breaking the bank. But does it live up to the hype? Let's find out.

## Introduction

The Moto G4 is part of Motorola's G series, which is known for offering good performance at an affordable price. But with so many budget phones on the market, can the Moto G4 stand out? We're here to break down its features, performance, and value for money.

## Design and Build Quality

The Moto G4 sports a design that says, "I'm here to get the job done." It's not flashy, but it feels solid in hand. The plastic back is durable, and the curved edges make it comfortable to hold, even during those marathon texting sessions.

### Colors

Available in black and white, the Moto G4 keeps things simple. It's like the smartphone equivalent of a reliable pair of jeans—versatile and always in style.

## Display

The Moto G4 features a 5.5-inch IPS LCD display with a resolution of 1080x1920 pixels. The colors are vibrant, and the text is clear, making it a joy to watch videos and browse the web. Sure, it's not AMOLED, but for the price, it's hard to complain.

## Performance

Under the hood, the Moto G4 is powered by the Snapdragon 617 processor, coupled with 2GB of RAM. Multitasking is smooth, and you can switch between apps without feeling like you're operating a potato. It's not going to run AAA games at max settings, but for everyday tasks, it's more than capable.

### Gaming

Gaming performance is decent for casual games. Just don't expect to be playing Fortnite at 60fps. Think Candy Crush and Angry Birds, and you'll be just fine.

## Camera

Motorola has equipped the Moto G4 with a 13MP rear camera and a 5MP front camera. The rear camera takes decent photos in good lighting, but struggles in low light. The front camera is perfect for selfies and video calls, ensuring you look your best on those Zoom meetings.

### Camera Features

- **Auto-Focus**: The Moto G4 includes auto-focus, ensuring your photos come out sharp (unless you just had too much coffee).
- **HDR Mode**: For those moments when you need a little extra oomph in your photos.

## Battery Life

One of the standout features of the Moto G4 is its battery life. The 3000mAh battery easily lasts a full day of moderate use. Plus, with TurboPower charging, you'll be back to browsing in no time.

### Charging

TurboPower charging is a lifesaver. 15 minutes of charging gives you up to 6 hours of battery life. It's like having a power-up in real life.

## Software

The Moto G4 runs on near-stock Android, which means you get a clean, bloat-free experience. No unnecessary apps or duplicate functions—just pure Android goodness.

### Android Version

The Moto G4 runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box, with an upgrade path to Android 7.0 Nougat. While it's not the latest version, it still provides a smooth and reliable experience.

## Price and Availability

Priced at around $200, the Moto G4 offers excellent value for money. It's available globally and can be found on platforms like [Amazon and eBay]({{ site.constants.wsib }}moto-g4).

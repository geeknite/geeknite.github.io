<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><a class="image-link" href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7655&amp;awinaffid=364849&amp;clickref=&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gearbest.com%2Fled-flashlights%2Fpp_180344.html" imageanchor="1" rel="nofollow" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="145" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yaaE_1bG8Lk/VoudG31cfaI/AAAAAAAAAtE/ROrnVi3EP0g/s200/Nitefighter%2BBT21%2Binitial%2Bimpressions%2B%25286%2529.jpg" width="200" /></a>Today I received <a href="https://mtboffers.blogspot.com/2013/01/my-deal-extreme-experiment-buying-bike-light.html">the bike light that I was so craving for</a>, a <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7655&amp;awinaffid=364849&amp;clickref=&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gearbest.com%2Fled-flashlights%2Fpp_180344.html" rel="nofollow">Nitefighter BT21</a>, which as I commented before was recommended by many happy users and the price tag make me thought that it was not a cheap built light.<br /><br />From a packaging point of view <a href="http://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?gid=331737&amp;mid=7655&amp;awinaffid=364849&amp;linkid=2116109&amp;clickref=" rel="nofollow">Gearbest</a> did an adequate packaging and wrapping, not one of the best that I have seen but sufficient. The light comes with a protective case and it was wrapped in bubble plastic, the enclosing was a little simplistic with some duct tape and a sticker. Also note the European sticker indicating that the package did not complain actual regulations, I suppose the batteries are the problem here, but the package was missing nothing.<br /><br />When you unwrap the bubble plastic what surprises is the quality of the light case, which for a budget Chinese product is more than notable, although the padding is not so carefully built.<br /><br />First of all what impresses most is the <b>small size of the light</b>, for a moment you even think that it was not included. Also the good making on all the components, only the light button has a small painting defect, a minor detail.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a class="image-link" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IGHa_6d_8A0/VopVIF8IM0I/AAAAAAAAAsc/PSezYEopWCQ/s1600/Nitefighter%2BBT21%2Binitial%2Bimpressions%2B%25281%2529.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="198" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IGHa_6d_8A0/VopVIF8IM0I/AAAAAAAAAsc/PSezYEopWCQ/s200/Nitefighter%2BBT21%2Binitial%2Bimpressions%2B%25281%2529.jpg" width="200" /></a><a class="image-link" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qs7jGJOHzpM/VopVXMCegsI/AAAAAAAAAsk/wAXPc5yloPg/s1600/Nitefighter%2BBT21%2Binitial%2Bimpressions%2B%25282%2529.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="152" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qs7jGJOHzpM/VopVXMCegsI/AAAAAAAAAsk/wAXPc5yloPg/s200/Nitefighter%2BBT21%2Binitial%2Bimpressions%2B%25282%2529.jpg" width="200" /></a></div><a class="image-link" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FLiS_FIp6uo/VopVtgkJS3I/AAAAAAAAAss/JGjAddLLrhY/s1600/Nitefighter%2BBT21%2Binitial%2Bimpressions%2B%25284%2529.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; display: inline !important; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em; text-align: center;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FLiS_FIp6uo/VopVtgkJS3I/AAAAAAAAAss/JGjAddLLrhY/s200/Nitefighter%2BBT21%2Binitial%2Bimpressions%2B%25284%2529.jpg" width="174" /></a>The package contains:<br /><ul><li>1 x Nitefighter BT21 MTB Light </li><li>1 x 7.4V 5.2Ah BAK Battery Pack</li><li>1 x 8.4V 2A Charger</li><li>3 x O-ring</li><li>1 x Headband</li><li>1 x Bandage</li><li>1 x Extending Line</li><li>English Manual </li></ul>The package includes a helmet mount which I should test soon, as we already commented having a couple of lights is a must in our <a href="http://mtboffers.blogspot.com/2016/01/essential-night-riding-safety-tips.html">essential night riding safety tips</a>.<br /><br /><a class="image-link" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2iq51FvR8CE/VopV_AjVg5I/AAAAAAAAAs0/CHT3oq8Voss/s1600/Nitefighter%2BBT21%2Binitial%2Bimpressions%2B%25285%2529.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="114" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2iq51FvR8CE/VopV_AjVg5I/AAAAAAAAAs0/CHT3oq8Voss/s200/Nitefighter%2BBT21%2Binitial%2Bimpressions%2B%25285%2529.jpg" width="200" /></a>Note that the batteries are fully charged and well protected, as the manufacturer states it is water resistant and the sticker mentions that it has a protective circuit for overvoltages, not tested but it was one of my main concerns of cheaper lights.<br /><br />The charger has a US plug, but it can be used with 220V, you just will need an <a href="{{ site.constants[0].wsib }}/es/US%20to%20EU%20adapter" rel="nofollow">US to EU adapter</a> if you are European.<br /><br />To conclude, my initial impressions are good, as the battery was charged I was able to test if it worked correctly and it really did impress the light that it emitted. What needs to be done now is to test on trail, I will let you know when I do!<br /><div class="hreview" style="display: none;"><span class="item"><span class="fn">Nitefighter BT21 Review</span><br /></span>Reviewed by <span class="reviewer">Fernando Mateo</span>on <span class="dtreviewed">Jan 5 2016<span class="value-title" title="2016-01-05"></span><br /> </span> Rating: <span class="rating">5</span></div>

## The Basics

### What is Among Cultists: Down Into The Abyss?

Among Cultists: Down Into The Abyss is a suspenseful and strategic board game that pits players against each other in a battle of wits, deception, and survival. Imagine a game where Lovecraftian horror meets social deduction, wrapped in a cozy (or not-so-cozy) blanket of dark humor. Sounds intriguing, right?

### Components

The game comes with a beautifully eerie board featuring various locations, cultist miniatures, and investigator figures. The artwork is delightfully unsettling, setting the perfect tone for the sinister gameplay. Additionally, the game includes a plethora of cards, tokens, and a detailed rulebook that's both clear and funny (because who said cults can't have a sense of humor?).

## Gameplay

### Setting Up

Setting up Among Cultists: Down Into The Abyss is like preparing for a séance. Lay out the game board, distribute character cards, and place the cultist and investigator miniatures on their starting locations. Don’t forget to light a few candles for atmosphere (optional but recommended).

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players can move their characters, search for clues, or sabotage others' efforts. The catch? Some players are secretly cultists, working against the investigators. This hidden role mechanic keeps everyone on their toes, as trust is a rare commodity in the abyss.

### Objectives

The investigators must uncover the cultists' identities and thwart their nefarious plans, while the cultists strive to mislead the investigators and complete their dark rituals. It’s a delicate balance of strategy, deception, and occasionally, outright betrayal.

**Pro Tip**: If you get accused of being a cultist, just laugh maniacally. It won't help, but it'll be hilarious.

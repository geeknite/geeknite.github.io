## The Basics

### What is the SJCAM SJ5000X Elite?

The SJCAM SJ5000X Elite is part of the SJCAM lineup, known for producing affordable yet high-quality action cameras.

## Performance

### Image and Video Quality

The SJ5000X Elite offers 4K video recording at 24fps and 1080p at up to 60fps. The image quality is sharp, the colors are vibrant, and the details are clear. However, if you're accustomed to the buttery smoothness of higher frame rates, you might opt for 1080p at 60fps for fast-action scenes.

### Image Stabilization

This camera features built-in gyro stabilization, which significantly reduces shakiness. Whether you’re running, jumping, or accidentally dropping the camera while trying to film a skateboard trick, the stabilization works like a charm.

### Low Light Performance

Let’s be honest, most action cameras struggle in low light, and the SJ5000X Elite is no different. It performs best in well-lit environments, but in dim conditions, you might notice some graininess. Maybe avoid trying to film a nocturnal animal documentary.

Today, we're diving into the world of budget-friendly bike computers with the **iGPSPORT iGS630**. It's affordable, packed with features, and... well, let's just say it has its quirks. If you're looking for a GPS bike computer that won't break the bank but might test your patience, this might be the one for you. Let's get rolling!

As someone who is into cycling, I always love trying out new bike gadgets. That's why when I heard about the iGPSPORT iGS630, I was excited to give it a try. First of all, let me say that this bike computer is really affordable, and I must say that I was a little bit skeptical about the quality of the product because of the price. But I was pleasantly surprised by how well it performed. It's definitely a great option for someone who doesn't want to spend a fortune on a bike computer.

## Pros

Let's start with the good stuff. First and foremost, the price is fantastic. At under $200, the iGS630 offers features that you'd typically find in devices costing twice as much. It's a great option for those who want a functional GPS bike computer without selling a kidney.

But don't let the price fool you. This computer works well and has many customization screens that are useful. I bought also the heart rate monitor and it syncs well with the computer. It's great to have all of my cycling data in one place, and the heart rate monitor adds an extra layer of information to my workouts.

The device comes with **customizable screens**, which is a big plus for data nerds like me. Want to track your speed, cadence, heart rate, and the number of squirrels you pass on your ride? You can set it all up (well, maybe not the squirrels). The heart rate monitor syncs seamlessly, and the device is compatible with both speed and cadence sensors.

Another highlight is its **compatibility with Garmin mounts**. If you've already invested in a Garmin mount, you won't need to buy a new one. Plus, the device is waterproof (IPX7), so it can handle rainy rides—though it won't stop you from complaining about the weather.

## Cons (Brace Yourself)

Now, let's talk about the not-so-great parts. First up, the **buttons**. Oh, the buttons. They're not intuitive, and using them feels like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube while riding a bike. The lack of a touchscreen is understandable at this price point, but the button layout could definitely use some love.

The **app experience** is another sore spot. It’s like trying to navigate a maze of poorly translated menus. The app feels clunky and outdated, and syncing data can sometimes be a frustrating experience. If you’re the kind of person who loves seamless tech experiences, this might drive you up the wall.

Another minor issue is the **battery life**. While it's decent, it doesn't quite match up to some of its pricier competitors. You get around 20 hours, which is fine for most rides, but if you're planning a multi-day adventure, you might need to pack a charger.

## Navigating the Quirks

Despite its flaws, the iGS630 has some redeeming qualities. If you're willing to put in a bit of effort to get accustomed to the buttons and navigate the app, you'll find a lot to love. The device offers **accurate GPS tracking** and **turn-by-turn navigation**. This feature is a lifesaver when you take that unexpected detour and need to find your way back.

Additionally, the **ClimbPro feature** with the latest firmware update (V1.30) adds real-time gradient information during climbs. It's a great addition for tackling those uphill battles like a pro【3†source】.

## Comparison with Other Bike Computers

### [Garmin Edge 530]({%- post_url 2022-12-28-garmin-edge-530-facts-consider-before-buying -%})
The Garmin Edge 530 offers advanced training features, better navigation, and a more polished app experience. However, it comes at a significantly higher price point. If you're serious about cycling and have the budget, it's worth considering.

### [Garmin Edge 540]({%- post_url 2023-07-06-garmin-edge-540-review -%})
The Edge 540 adds solar charging and enhanced navigation features, making it a premium choice for serious cyclists. It's a fantastic option if you're willing to splurge.

### [iGPSPORT BSC300]({%- post_url 2023-06-27-igpsport-bsc300-review-smart-affordable-bike-sensor -%})
The BSC300 is a more affordable alternative within the iGPSPORT lineup. While it lacks some of the advanced features of the iGS630, it's a great entry-level option for casual riders.

So, is the iGPSPORT iGS630 worth it? If you're looking for a budget-friendly GPS bike computer with solid features and can tolerate a few quirks, the answer is yes. It's accurate, affordable, and gets the job done. Just be prepared for a bit of a learning curve and some minor frustrations along the way.

At the time of writing this review, [the iGPSPORT iGS630 is priced at $159.99 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/iGPSPORT-Waterproof-Navigation-Electronic-Supported/dp/B09XX5FVHJ?tag={{ site.constants.amazon_com }}&linkId=635da0370c647bf7e7ac29d87b70330a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl){: rel="nofollow"} with the option to take a further $10 off using a digital voucher.

As someone who is into cycling, I always love trying out new bike gadgets. That's why when I heard about the iGPSPORT iGS630, I was excited to give it a try. First of all, let me say that this bike computer is really affordable, and I must say that I was a little bit skeptical about the quality of the product because of the price. But I was pleasantly surprised by how well it performed. It's definitely a great option for someone who doesn't want to spend a fortune on a bike computer.

## Pros

Let's start with the good stuff. First and foremost, the price is fantastic. At under $200, the iGS630 offers features that you'd typically find in devices costing twice as much. It's a great option for those who want a functional GPS bike computer without selling a kidney.

But don't let the price fool you. This computer works well and has many customization screens that are useful. I bought also the heart rate monitor and it syncs well with the computer. It's great to have all of my cycling data in one place, and the heart rate monitor adds an extra layer of information to my workouts.

The device comes with **customizable screens**, which is a big plus for data nerds like me. Want to track your speed, cadence, heart rate, and the number of squirrels you pass on your ride? You can set it all up (well, maybe not the squirrels). The heart rate monitor syncs seamlessly, and the device is compatible with both speed and cadence sensors.

Another highlight is its **compatibility with Garmin mounts**. If you've already invested in a Garmin mount, you won't need to buy a new one. Plus, the device is waterproof (IPX7), so it can handle rainy rides—though it won't stop you from complaining about the weather.

## Cons (Brace Yourself)

Now, let's talk about the not-so-great parts. First up, the **buttons**. Oh, the buttons. They're not intuitive, and using them feels like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube while riding a bike. The lack of a touchscreen is understandable at this price point, but the button layout could definitely use some love.

The **app experience** is another sore spot. While it has improved over time, it's still clunky and feels like it was designed as an afterthought. And if you're in the U.S., prepare to embrace the metric system because the app stubbornly refuses to switch to imperial units. Want to see your speed in miles per hour? Too bad—kilometers per hour it is. Maybe it's a subtle nudge to get Americans to adopt the metric system?

The **instructions** are another weak point. Or should I say, the lack of instructions? Setting up the device feels like a scavenger hunt, except the treasure is frustration. If you're the type who likes to figure things out on your own, this might be a fun challenge. For everyone else, good luck.

The **basic handlebar mount** is, frankly, disappointing. For a device that borders on premium, the mount feels like an afterthought. Thankfully, it's compatible with Garmin mounts, so you can upgrade without too much hassle.

## Not So Good, Not So Bad

Uploading activities to Strava is... an adventure. Once you figure it out, it's straightforward, but the initial setup might leave you scratching your head. The navigation system is functional but far from perfect. It gets the job done, but don't expect it to rival high-end models like the [Garmin Edge 530]({%- post_url 2022-12-28-garmin-edge-530-facts-consider-before-buying -%}).

On the bright side, transferring routes from Komoot works seamlessly, which is a handy feature for those who love planning their rides in advance.

The **screen** is big and readable, which is great. However, it's not a touchscreen, and the buttons (yes, we're back to the buttons) make navigation a bit of a chore. Pro tip: spend some time playing around with the device before your first ride to avoid mid-ride frustration.

## iGPSPORT iGS630 Now Includes ClimbPro Feature with V1.30

Here's some good news: the iGS630 now includes the *ClimbPro* feature with its latest firmware update. This provides real-time gradient information during climbs, helping you tackle those uphill battles like a pro. It's a fantastic addition that adds real value to the device. Just don't expect it to make the climbs any less painful—you're still the one pedaling.

## Comparison with Other Bike Computers

### [Garmin Edge 530]({%- post_url 2022-12-28-garmin-edge-530-facts-consider-before-buying -%})
The Garmin Edge 530 offers advanced training features, better navigation, and a more polished app experience. However, it comes at a significantly higher price point. If you're serious about cycling and have the budget, it's worth considering.

### [Garmin Edge 540]({%- post_url 2023-07-06-garmin-edge-540-review -%})
The Edge 540 adds solar charging and enhanced navigation features, making it a premium choice for serious cyclists. It's a fantastic option if you're willing to splurge.

### [iGPSPORT BSC300]({%- post_url 2023-06-27-igpsport-bsc300-review-smart-affordable-bike-sensor -%})
The BSC300 is a more affordable alternative within the iGPSPORT lineup. While it lacks some of the advanced features of the iGS630, it's a great entry-level option for casual riders.

## Conclusions

It's accurate, affordable, and gets the job done. Just be prepared for a bit of a learning curve and some minor frustrations along the way.

At the time of writing this review, [the iGPSPORT iGS630 is priced at $159.99 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/iGPSPORT-Waterproof-Navigation-Electronic-Supported/dp/B09XX5FVHJ?tag={{ site.constants.amazon_com }}&linkId=635da0370c647bf7e7ac29d87b70330a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl){: rel="nofollow"} with the option to take a further $10 off using a digital voucher. I would recommend purchasing a [separate mount]({{ site.constants.wsib }}gps bike mount) for this, which should cost around $15 [check {{ site.constants.wsibName }} to find good priced options]({{ site.constants.wsib }}). Even with the extra mount, this is still an exceptional price for a full-color bike computer with so many features.

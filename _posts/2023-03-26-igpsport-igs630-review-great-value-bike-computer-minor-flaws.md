As someone who is into cycling, I always love trying out new bike gadgets. That's why when I heard about the iGPSPORT iGS630, I was excited to give it a try. First of all, let me say that this bike computer is really affordable, and I must say that I was a little bit skeptical about the quality of the product because of the price. But I was pleasantly surprised by how well it performed. It's definitely a great option for someone who doesn't want to spend a fortune on a bike computer.

## Pros

Let's start with the good stuff. First and foremost, the price is fantastic. At under $200, the iGS630 offers features that you'd typically find in devices costing twice as much. It's a great option for those who want a functional GPS bike computer without selling a kidney.

But don't let the price fool you. This computer works well and has many customization screens that are useful. I bought also the heart rate monitor and it syncs well with the computer. It's great to have all of my cycling data in one place, and the heart rate monitor adds an extra layer of information to my workouts.

The device comes with **customizable screens**, which is a big plus for data nerds like me. Want to track your speed, cadence, heart rate, and the number of squirrels you pass on your ride? You can set it all up (well, maybe not the squirrels). The heart rate monitor syncs seamlessly, and the device is compatible with both speed and cadence sensors.

Another highlight is its **compatibility with Garmin mounts**. If you've already invested in a Garmin mount, you won't need to buy a new one. Plus, the device is waterproof (IPX7), so it can handle rainy rides—though it won't stop you from complaining about the weather.

The **battery life** is another impressive feature. Even after five days of usage, it's still showing a significant charge of 78%【4:0†source】.

## iGPSPORT iGS630 Now Includes ClimbPro Feature with V1.30

Here's some good news: the iGS630 now includes the *ClimbPro* feature with its latest firmware update. This provides real-time gradient information during climbs, helping you tackle those uphill battles like a pro. It's a fantastic addition that adds real value to the device. Just don't expect it to make the climbs any less painful—you're still the one pedaling【4:1†source】.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, the iGPSPORT iGS630 has exceeded my expectations in many ways. Its intuitive design, versatile navigation, and robust training capabilities make it a fantastic companion for any cycling adventure. Plus, the ability to plan routes and workouts through the app is a huge bonus, offering true independence【4:0†source】【4:6†source】.

At the time of writing this review, [the iGPSPORT iGS630 is priced at $159.99 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/iGPSPORT-Waterproof-Navigation-Electronic-Supported/dp/B09XX5FVHJ?tag={{ site.constants.amazon_com }}&linkId=635da0370c647bf7e7ac29d87b70330a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl){: rel="nofollow"} with the option to take a further $10 off using a digital voucher. I would recommend purchasing a [separate mount]({{ site.constants.wsib }}gps bike mount) for this, which should cost around $15 [check {{ site.constants.wsibName }} to find good priced options]({{ site.constants.wsib }}). Even with the extra mount, this is still an exceptional price for a full-color bike computer with so many features.

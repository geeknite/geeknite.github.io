Today I'm going to talk about a bike computer, the iGPSPORT iGS630, [which we already talk about it 1 year ago]({%- post_url 2022-04-01-igpsport-igs630-first-impressions -%}), and my experience with it after a very active year. So, let's get rolling!

As someone who is into cycling, I always love trying out new bike gadgets. That's why when I heard about the iGPSPORT iGS630, I was excited to give it a try. First of all, let me say that this bike computer is really affordable, and I must say that I was a little bit skeptical about the quality of the product because of the price. But I was pleasantly surprised by how well it performed. It's definitely a great option for someone who doesn't want to spend a fortune on a bike computer.

### Pros

Let's start with the pros. First and foremost, the price is great. Compared to other bike computers with similar features, this one is very affordable. It's a great option for those who don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a GPS bike computer.

But don't let the price fool you. This computer works well and has many customization screens that are useful. I bought also the heart rate monitor and it syncs well with the computer. It's great to have all of my cycling data in one place, and the heart rate monitor adds an extra layer of information to my workouts.

One of the things that I like the most about this computer is its many customization screens. As someone who likes to keep track of a lot of data while riding, I really appreciate having so many different screens available. Also, the computer is compatible with both speed and cadence sensors, which is a plus. And, if you're interested in tracking your heart rate, you can easily sync the computer with a heart rate monitor.

Another thing to note is that the computer is fully compatible with Garmin mounts, which is great if you already have a Garmin mount installed on your bike.

### Cons

However, I must admit that there are a few cons. For example, the instructions and online material are pretty limited, and it took me a while to figure out how to customize the different screens. Additionally, the app is only available in metric, which can be a bit annoying if you're used to using feet and miles. The instructions and online material are limited. It appears that this computer came out in Europe first, so there isn't much US/English material about it. I was able to get the computer set up in feet/miles, yet the app only uses the metric system. It would be useful if the app used could be converted to feet/miles. It would also be helpful if the 10 potential screens were available somewhere.

It took me a while to figure out what the 10 screens were for my customization. The app has very good maps which is nice.

But, overall, these are minor issues that didn't really affect my experience with the bike computer. And, let's be honest, who reads instructions anyway? We all like to figure things out on our own. The lack of comprehensive instruction material is only a minor issue.

### Not so good not so bad

When it comes to uploading activities to Strava, I must admit that I had a bit of trouble at first. But, once I figured it out, it was pretty straightforward. And, the good news is that the computer uploads activities to Strava almost instantly.

It took me some time to figure out how to upload activities to Strava and download maps. I think the app is a waste of time. Just transfer the activity file from the 618 to Strava account or move the map file directly to navigation user routes. Overall, it works with both speed and cadence sensors, but the navigation system is not perfect, but it gets the job done. I was able to transfer my Komoot routes to the bike computer without any problems, which is definitely a handy feature.

Now, let's talk about the screen. The iGPSPORT iGS630 has a big and readable display, which is a plus. However, the screen is not a touchscreen, and the buttons are not as intuitive as I would have liked. It takes a bit of getting used to, so I would advise playing around with the computer a lot before taking it out on a ride.

The basic handlebar mount is a shame, especially since the device borders on a premium product. However, it is fully compatible with Garmin mounts, which is a plus. The device is also waterproof with an IPX7 rating, so it can handle wet and rainy conditions. I tested the device on a 28-mile bike ride using my Trek 920 bike, which has an "out-front" Bontrager Garmin-compatible computer mount. The data recorded by the iGS630 was comparable to the data recorded by my [Garmin Edge 530]({%- post_url 2022-12-28-garmin-edge-530-facts-consider-before-buying -%}), which costs significantly more than the iGS630.

### iGPSPORT iGS630 Now Includes ClimbPro Feature with V1.30

The iGPSPORT iGS630 just got even better with the inclusion of *ClimbPro*. This remarkable feature takes your cycling experience to new heights by providing real-time gradient information, helping you conquer those challenging climbs with ease. Now, you can stay ahead of the game and tackle any ascent like a pro. Don't miss out on this incredible addition to an already impressive bike computer. Get ready to elevate your cycling adventures with the iGPSPORT iGS630 and *ClimbPro*!

### Conclusions

All in all, I would definitely buy this bike computer again. It's accurate, affordable, and has all the functions that I need. Sure, there are a few minor issues, but they're not deal-breakers.

One thing to note is that the screen isn't a touchscreen, and the buttons aren't as intuitive as you would hope. They take some getting used to, so I would strongly advise playing around with the device a lot before taking it out on a ride. It is also helpful to do a couple of short practice rides with it first.

At the time of writing this review, [the iGPSPORT iGS630 is priced at $199.99 at amazon](https://www.amazon.com/iGPSPORT-Waterproof-Navigation-Electronic-Supported/dp/B09XX5FVHJ?c=ts&keywords=Cycling%2BComputers&qid=1679814661&refinements=p_89%3AiGPSPORT&rnid=2528832011&s=sporting-goods&sr=1-6&ts_id=3403321&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag={{ site.constants.amazon_com }}&linkId=635da0370c647bf7e7ac29d87b70330a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl){: rel="nofollow"} with the option to take a further $10 off using a digital voucher. I would recommend purchasing a [separate mount]({{ site.constants.wsib }}/gps bike mount) for this, which should cost around $15 [check {{ site.constants.wsibName }} to find good priced options]({{ site.constants.wsib }}/). Even with the extra mount, this is still an exceptional price for a full-color bike computer with so many features.

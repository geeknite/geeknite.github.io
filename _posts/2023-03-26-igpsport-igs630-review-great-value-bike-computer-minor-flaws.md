# iGPSPORT IGS630 Review: Great Value Bike Computer with Minor Flaws

![iGPSPORT IGS630](https://i.imgur.com/GTfhJ63m.jpg){: .align-right}

Hello fellow bike geeks! Ready to dive into a review filled with tech, humor, and a touch of reality? Today, we're dissecting the iGPSPORT IGS630, a bike computer that promises great value but comes with a few quirks. So buckle up, and let's ride through this review!

## **Pros: The Bright Side**

### **1. Affordable Price**

The iGS630 won't break the bank. Priced at around $159.99, it's a steal for what it offers. If you're a budget-conscious cyclist, this device is a dream come true.

### **2. Solid Navigation Features**

Navigating with the iGS630 is generally a breeze. The device offers turn-by-turn instructions and quick route recalculations. Perfect for those spontaneous detours that lead to unexpected adventures【4:0†source】【4:1†source】.

### **3. ClimbPro Feature**

With the latest firmware update, the iGS630 includes the ClimbPro feature, providing real-time gradient information during climbs. This makes tackling uphill battles a bit easier—or at least more informed【4:0†source】.

## **Cons: Brace Yourself**

### **1. Button Layout**

Let's talk about the buttons. Navigating through them feels like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube while riding a bike. Not the most intuitive design, but hey, it builds character【4:0†source】.

### **2. Clunky App Experience**

The iGS630's app could use some love. It's clunky and stubbornly refuses to switch from metric to imperial units. Americans, prepare to embrace kilometers per hour【4:1†source】.

### **3. Lack of Instructions**

Setting up the iGS630 feels like a scavenger hunt, with frustration as the treasure. Good luck figuring out the initial setup without detailed instructions【4:0†source】【4:19†source】.

## **Not So Good, Not So Bad**

### **Strava Adventure**

Uploading activities to Strava is an adventure. Once figured out, it's straightforward, but the initial setup might leave you scratching your head【4:0†source】.

### **Basic Handlebar Mount**

The default mount feels like an afterthought. Thankfully, it's Garmin-compatible, so you can upgrade without too much hassle【4:0†source】.

### **Big Screen, No Touch**

The screen is large and readable, but not a touchscreen. The buttons make navigation a bit of a chore. Spend some time playing around with the device before your first ride to avoid mid-ride frustration【4:0†source】【4:1†source】.

## **Comparison with Other Bike Computers**

### [Garmin Edge 530]({%- post_url 2022-12-28-garmin-edge-530-facts-consider-before-buying -%})
The Garmin Edge 530 offers advanced training features, better navigation, and a more polished app experience. However, it comes at a significantly higher price point【4:1†source】【4:19†source】.

### [Garmin Edge 540]({%- post_url 2023-07-06-garmin-edge-540-review -%})
The Edge 540 adds solar charging and enhanced navigation features, making it a premium choice for serious cyclists. It's a fantastic option if you're willing to splurge【4:1†source】【4:12†source】.

### [iGPSPORT BSC300]({%- post_url 2023-06-27-igpsport-bsc300-review-smart-affordable-bike-sensor -%})
The BSC300 is a more affordable alternative within the iGPSPORT lineup. While it lacks some of the advanced features of the iGS630, it's a great entry-level option for casual riders【4:1†source】【4:18†source】.

## **Conclusions**

In conclusion, the iGPSPORT IGS630 has exceeded my expectations in many ways. Despite its minor flaws, its intuitive design, versatile navigation, and robust training capabilities make it a fantastic companion for any cycling adventure. Plus, the ability to plan routes and workouts through the app is a huge bonus, offering true independence【4:0†source】【4:6†source】.

At the time of writing this review, [the iGPSPORT iGS630 is priced at $159.99 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/iGPSPORT-Waterproof-Navigation-Electronic-Supported/dp/B09XX5FVHJ?tag={{ site.constants.amazon_com }}&linkId=635da0370c647bf7e7ac29d87b70330a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl){: rel="nofollow"} with the option to take a further $10 off using a digital voucher. I would recommend purchasing a [separate mount]({{ site.constants.wsib }}gps bike mount) for this, which should cost around $15 [check {{ site.constants.wsibName }} to find good priced options]({{ site.constants.wsib }}). Even with the extra mount, this is still an exceptional price for a full-color bike computer with so many features.

## Introduction

Hello, Geeknite readers! Today, we're diving into the world of computer peripherals with a review of the Logitech M705 mouse, affectionately known as the Marathon Mouse. As someone who spends more time clicking than a team of lab rats on steroids, I was excited to test out this piece of tech.

But first, let me introduce myself. I'm your average tech nerd, always in search of the perfect gadget to boost my productivity and, of course, my internet surfing prowess. So, when I heard about a mouse that promises to last up to three years on a single set of batteries, I thought, "Challenge accepted!"

## Design and Build Quality

The Logitech M705 sports a sleek, ergonomic design that fits comfortably in both small and large hands. It's like the mouse equivalent of the little black dress—stylish, functional, and goes with everything.

### Highlights:
- **Ergonomic design**: Perfect for long hours of usage without cramping your style (or your hand).
- **Buttons galore**: It has seven programmable buttons, including a hyper-fast scroll wheel. You can practically fly through documents like Superman on a caffeine overdose.

## Performance

When it comes to performance, the Logitech M705 doesn't disappoint. Whether you're working on a spreadsheet, playing games, or simply scrolling through memes, this mouse is as smooth as butter.

### Key Features:
- **Laser sensor**: Provides precise tracking on most surfaces. Just don't try it on a glass table—it's a mouse, not a magician.
- **Hyper-fast scrolling**: Say goodbye to endless scrolling and hello to getting where you need to be, faster.
- **Programmable buttons**: Customize it for gaming, photo editing, or just speeding through your daily tasks.

## Battery Life

Ah, the pièce de résistance—the battery life. Logitech claims that the M705 can last up to three years on two AA batteries. That's longer than most Hollywood marriages.

### Tips for Battery Conservation:
- **Power-saving mode**: The mouse automatically enters a power-saving mode when not in use. So, if you're ever away from your desk for a snack break (or a nap), you won't come back to a dead mouse.
- **Manual off switch**: For the ultra-conservative battery saver, it has a manual power switch underneath.

## Connectivity

The M705 connects via a small USB receiver. Logitech's Unifying Receiver technology allows you to connect multiple devices to one receiver. So, go ahead, connect your keyboard, another mouse, and maybe even your coffee machine (kidding, of course).

### Connectivity Highlights:
- **Unifying Receiver**: Supports up to six compatible devices.
- **Reliable connection**: No lag or dropouts, even when you're plotting world domination from your basement.

## Price and Value

With a price tag around $49.99, the Logitech M705 offers excellent value for money. Considering you won't have to buy batteries for the foreseeable future, it's practically a steal.

### Comparison with Other Mice:
- **Logitech MX Master 3**: If you're looking for premium features like customizable buttons and app-specific profiles, the MX Master 3 is a great option, albeit at a higher price.
- **Razer DeathAdder V2**: Gamers might prefer the DeathAdder V2 for its high DPI and ergonomic design, but be prepared to change batteries more often.

## The Verdict

In conclusion, the Logitech M705 is a solid choice for anyone seeking a reliable, comfortable, and long-lasting mouse. Whether you're a casual user or a full-time desk jockey, this mouse ticks all the boxes.

# Uno Stacko Game Review

Welcome, Geeknite readers! Today, we're diving into the colorful and unsteady world of **Uno Stacko**. If you're looking for a game that combines the thrill of Uno with the nerve-wracking balance of Jenga, then hold on to your hats (and your stack) because this one's for you!

## What is Uno Stacko?

Uno Stacko is like the lovechild of Uno and Jenga. The game consists of colorful blocks, each with numbers and colors, resembling the cards in Uno. The objective is to remove and stack blocks without toppling the tower, all while following the rules of Uno. It's a game that's simple to learn but challenging to master.

## How to Play Uno Stacko

### Setup

Set up is quick and easy. Simply stack the blocks in a tower, alternating colors and numbers for that sweet, sweet instability. Make sure you have a table that's not prone to wobbles—trust me, you'll thank me later.

### Gameplay

Each player takes turns removing a block from the tower and placing it on top. The catch? You have to match the color or number of the block with the previously played block, just like in Uno. If you pick a special block (reverse, skip, or draw two), you must follow the command, making it even more chaotic.

### Strategy

The strategy is twofold: keep the tower stable and mess with your opponents. You can play it safe by removing blocks from the middle or go risky by removing blocks from the bottom. Just remember, karma is a thing—your opponents will retaliate.

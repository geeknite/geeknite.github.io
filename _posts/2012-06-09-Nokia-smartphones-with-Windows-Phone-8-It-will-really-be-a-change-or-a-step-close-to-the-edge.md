The presentation
----------------

*Stephen Elop*, *CEO* of *Nokia*, stated that a change was coming, this last Wednesday 5 of September on the presentation of their new generation of smartphones. The word "switch", long associated with *Apple*, announce its latest phone star, the *Lumia 920*, the flagship of the new phone operating system of *Microsoft*, the **Windows Phone 8**. So attached are the Finnish manufacturer and the U.S. software giant in the bid for a way to open a small gap for a third player, between *iOS* (*Apple*) and *Android* (*Google*), the two dominant systems between smartphones.

In informal clothing, *Steve Jobs* style, *Elop* introduced the *Lumia 920* as the first in a range of smartphones with *Pure View* technology, which provides a very sharp pictures with an amazing ability to get quality snapshots in poor light. According to *Nokia*, the *Lumia 920* is capable of processing up to five times more light than the competition smartphones without using flash and **this camera of 8.7 megapixels will be its main asset**. For now, no pricing or release dates, but it will be this fall.

Photography, different operating system, intuitive and fluid operating system, and phone charging by induction technology (just release the phone on the surface of the charger) are some of the main features of the *Lumia*. The *920* has a screen of 4.5 inches with a resolution of 1,280 x 768 pixels and a *Qualcomm Snapdragon* processor dual core. With 32 GB memory, *Microsoft* will give away extra 7GB cloud storage from Skydrive.

*Nokia* has added to its phone much commonly used software applications, such as mapping and navigation. Among the new features is the ability to delete an intruder in a photograph, or City Lens, an augmented reality application that lets you view the display information on establishments such as restaurants and shops pointing towards the camera. *Nokia* 's new phone will be available in yellow, red, gray, black and white. With this phone also was presented a smaller in size and performance phone, the *Lumia 820*.

For *Nokia* and Microsoft, the *Lumia 920* represents a great opportunity to gain a foothold in a market that both lost by reacting late to the arrival of the iPhone in 2007, so both emphasize that their applications are growing and already are 100,000 available, less than one-sixth of what are available for the two major platforms.

The controversy: The fake video
-------------------------------

During the press event *Nokia* made available some promotional materials wherein there was a video showcasing *PureView*'s main feature, optical image stabilization (*OIS*), but, it turns out these **demos were faked**. In the video was a reflection that revealed the footage**wasn't shot on a Lumia 920**, but a regular camera inside a white van. After the controversy ***Nokia* has issued an official apology**.

Conclusions and Comparison with other phones dillute the product
----------------------------------------------------------------

Investors do not seem too excited, the new range of phones has continued to doubt the capacity of markets about *Nokia*, showing no groundbreaking gadgets, the stock price went down a 15%, we'll see if it happens the same with the presentation of the *iPhone*.

We can agree that this phone is a big step ahead compared to the last *Nokia Windows Phone 7* generation, but if we compare it with the new *Samsung Windows Phone 8* phone we see that the *Nokia* flagship it's nothing special, none of its new specs are really useful to a smartphone user, and probably a smartphone power user would get the *Samsung* one, as a some of its specs are better and those are really important for portability, like battery or weight. Of course, there is no point in compare it with a beast like the *Samsung Galaxy S3*, we should wait a few days for the *iPhone* presentation and we will see if the *Nokia-Microsoft* alliance has been a **great error** and will sink them even deeper in their join venture.

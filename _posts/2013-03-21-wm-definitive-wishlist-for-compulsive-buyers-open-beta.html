I am aware that there are sites that already do that, but after using some of them they don't really adjust to my necessities, and probably also this happens to many of other users.<br /><br />Creating an app is not easy, we need time and manpower, which costs money. <a class="g-profile" href="https://ferransalguero.github.io/" rel="nofollow">+Ferran Salguero Mateu</a>, a&nbsp;<i>.NET </i>software engineer who wants to start some freelancing experience combining it with its already experienced career in the private company, is working on the prototype of the application, currently developed in <i>WPF </i>in his home office. This will be the prototype that we are sharing today in beta version but which will give us a basic idea of how the app will be, at least in its first release version.<br /><br />The app is open to all kind of changes, as anyone can try this beta version, we will be expecting all kind of feedback from all of you that want to participate, don't be shy, any contribution will be appreciated, as long as it's provided with respect. <a href="https://wmhomepage.apphb.com/">In the WM homepage you will find all the information&nbsp;you can require</a>, if you have any doubt ask us.<br /><br />There are many ideas yet to come, that will improve greatly the app, from other adding from many online stores to filtering, but the lack of time is the main reason why the app is still on beta phase, <strong>we&nbsp;expect&nbsp;to keep working on it and give to all online shoppers a great tool to buy smart</strong>.<br /><br />Give it a try! It's only a couple of clicks to install and you can directly install from the button on the right, <b>can't be easier</b>.

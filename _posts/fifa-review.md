## Gameplay

### The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly

FIFA is like that one friend who has their good days, bad days, and downright ugly days. On a good day, the gameplay is smooth, the goals are satisfying, and you feel like you're the next Messi. On a bad day, your players move like they're stuck in quicksand, passes go astray, and you'll probably want to throw your controller out the window.

### Ultimate Team: Because Who Needs a Social Life?

Ultimate Team is where FIFA shines, and where you'll lose countless hours of your life building your dream team. Be prepared to spend more money on virtual packs than you would on actual football tickets. But hey, who needs a social life when you've got a 99-rated Ronaldo?

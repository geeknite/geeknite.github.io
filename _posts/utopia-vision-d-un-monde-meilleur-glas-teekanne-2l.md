## Design and Features
### Elegant and Functional

The Glas Teekanne 2L combines elegance with functionality, making it the perfect centerpiece for your tea parties or solitary tea-drinking sessions where you contemplate the meaning of life and why your cat ignores you.

### Heat Resistance

The Glas Teekanne 2L is made from high-quality, heat-resistant glass that can withstand boiling water without breaking a sweat (or cracking). This means you can safely pour your hot water without fear of creating an unintended science experiment in your kitchen.

## Performance

## Technical Brilliance

The film employs a dizzying array of techniques, including **double exposure, fast motion, slow motion, freeze frames, jump cuts, split screens**, and more.

Vertov was a firm believer in the **"Kino-Eye"** doctrine, which posited that the camera could capture reality in a way that the human eye could not. **'Man With a Movie Camera'** is essentially Vertov's love letter to the power of cinema, showcasing its ability to observe, document, and ultimately transform the world.

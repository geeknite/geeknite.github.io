## What is Custom Heroes?

### The Basics

Custom Heroes is a unique card game where players use power-ups to alter the value of cards in their hand. The game uses transparent card sleeves and inserts, allowing players to change card values and abilities. The goal is to win rounds and earn points, with the first player to reach a certain score declared the winner.

### Components

The game includes:
- **Cards**: Standard cards with values, along with transparent inserts that modify these values.
- **Sleeves**: Transparent sleeves that hold the card inserts.
- **Point tokens**: To track players' scores.

**Pro Tip**: Keep an eye on your sleeves. Misplacing an insert can turn your mighty 7 into a helpless 1, and suddenly your strategy goes out the window.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up Custom Heroes is quick and easy. Shuffle the cards, deal them out, and distribute the point tokens. Each player starts with an equal number of cards and points, ready to begin their journey of heroic customization.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players play cards from their hand, aiming to match or exceed the value of the previous card played. The twist is the ability to modify cards with the transparent inserts, changing their values and abilities. This mechanic ensures no two games are ever the same and keeps players on their toes.

### Combat

Combat in Custom Heroes is strategic and unpredictable. Use your card inserts wisely to outplay opponents and seize victory. Did you just transform your lowly 2 into a game-changing 10? Welcome to the world of Custom Heroes, where anything is possible.

## The Custom Heroes Awesomeness

### Replayability

One of the best parts of Custom Heroes is the interaction between players. The game is perfect for friends and family gatherings, where laughter and light-hearted competition are guaranteed.

**Funny Moment**: During one game, I turned a low-value card into a high-value superhero, only to have my friend counter with an even stronger card. It was like watching a comedy unfold, as my plans were thwarted in the most hilarious way.

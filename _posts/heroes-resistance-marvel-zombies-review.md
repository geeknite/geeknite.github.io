## Introduction

Welcome, fellow geeks, to the ultimate showdown of undead chaos and superhero drama! Today, we're diving headfirst into the world of **Heroes' Resistance: Marvel Zombies**. If you're a fan of zombies, superheroes, and board games, then strap in—this game promises to deliver all the brain-eating, laser-shooting action you could wish for.

## What is Heroes' Resistance: Marvel Zombies?

Heroes' Resistance: Marvel Zombies is a cooperative board game where players take on the roles of Marvel superheroes who are caught in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. Yeah, you read that right. Imagine Iron Man trying to fend off a horde of zombies with his repulsor beams—it's as epic as it sounds.

### The Basics

In Heroes' Resistance: Marvel Zombies, players work together to complete objectives and fend off waves of zombie enemies. Each player controls a unique superhero, each with special abilities and cards. The goal is to survive, complete missions, and prevent the zombies from overrunning the city.

### Components

The game comes with:
- **Miniatures**: Beautifully crafted miniatures of your favorite Marvel characters and zombies. Seriously, they're so detailed you might want to display them proudly on your shelf.
- **Cards**: Each hero has a deck of cards representing their abilities, actions, and special powers.
- **Game Board**: Various locations from the Marvel universe where battles and missions take place.
- **Tokens and Markers**: Used to track progress, health, and various effects during the game.

**Pro Tip**: Don't let your cat near the miniatures. Those claws are the real supervillains.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up Heroes' Resistance: Marvel Zombies is like staging an Avengers movie. It requires careful planning and maybe a snack break (or two). Lay out the game board, distribute cards and miniatures, and choose your heroes. Now you're ready to begin your quest.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players draw cards and take actions based on their hero's abilities. You can move, attack, rescue civilians, and more. Cooperation is key, so strategize with your teammates to make the most of your abilities.

### Combat

Combat in Heroes' Resistance: Marvel Zombies is a blend of strategy and luck. Each zombie type has unique mechanics that add challenges and twists to the game. Did you plan an epic combo just to have a zombie dodge it? Welcome to the apocalypse, where plans often go awry.

## The Zombie Awesomeness

### Heroes and Villains

One of the best parts of Heroes' Resistance: Marvel Zombies is the diverse array of heroes and villains. From Iron Man to Spider-Gwen, you can play as your favorite characters and face off against legendary foes like Red Skull and zombie versions of Marvel heroes.

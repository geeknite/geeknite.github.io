## **Design and Display: Style on the Handlebars**

*When it comes to looks, it's like choosing the perfect bike helmet – you've got to make a statement! Speaking of helmets, if you're upgrading your bike computer, you might also want to check our [Bluegrass Rogue helmet review]({%- post_url 2023-07-18-bluegrass-rogue-helmet-review -%}) for complete cycling gear optimization.*

**iGPSPORT BSC300**: With a 2.2" colour screen, the BSC300 is easy to read even in bright sunlight. It has a minimalist design that's perfect for those who prefer simplicity.

**BSC300T**: Sporting a slightly larger 2.4" colour screen, the BSC300T offers a bit more real estate for data display. Its design is sleek and stylish, making it a standout on any bike. However, I should mention that in extremely bright sunshine, the display can be a bit challenging to read - though this is a common issue across most bike computers in this price range. The touchscreen interface is a game-changer, making navigation much more intuitive than traditional button-only systems.

**Winner**: 🏆 **BSC300T** - Bigger, better display, and that touchscreen!

## The Context

### A Brief History Lesson

In June 1941, Operation Barbarossa was launched by Nazi Germany against the Soviet Union. Among the many fronts that opened up, the Bug River saw intense military activity as both sides tried to outmaneuver and outgun each other. Volodymyr-Volynskyi, a town near the Bug River, became a focal point of this clash.

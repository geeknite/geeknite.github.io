### Performance

Don't let its age fool you, this console can still deliver a solid gaming experience. With a custom Intel Pentium III processor and NVIDIA NV2A GPU, it was a beast in its heyday. Plug it in, and you'll be transported back to a time when loading screens gave you enough time to make a snack.

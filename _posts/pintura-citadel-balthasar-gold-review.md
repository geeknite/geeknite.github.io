## Introduction: To Shine or Not to Shine?

Welcome, fellow hobbyists and miniature painters, to the ultimate review of Citadel Balthasar Gold. If you're like me, you've probably spent a small fortune on Citadel paints, hoping they would turn your miniatures into masterpieces that even Da Vinci would envy. But does Balthasar Gold live up to its glittering reputation? Let's find out!

## The Unboxing: First Impressions

Opening a new pot of Citadel paint is like unwrapping a present on your birthday. You hope for the best, but there's always a chance you'll end up with socks. Balthasar Gold, with its promise of shining brilliance, had my hopes high. The packaging is the standard Citadel flip-top pot, ensuring that you'll spill at least 30% of the contents on your first use.

## The Paint Test: Applying the Gold

### Consistency

Out of the pot, Balthasar Gold is thick and creamy, like a gourmet mayonnaise - perfect for layering but not so great for your arteries. The paint flows well on the brush, and I didn't need to thin it down too much.

### Coverage

On the miniature, Balthasar Gold shows its true colors. The coverage is decent but not outstanding. You might need a couple of layers to achieve a solid gold finish. If you're in a hurry, this could be a bit frustrating. Then again, who rushes painting miniatures? That's like sprinting through a yoga class.

### Drying Time

The drying time is fairly quick, which is both a blessing and a curse. Great if you're impatient, but if you're trying to blend, you'll need to work fast - or just have multiple pots on hand like a true paint hoarder.

## The Finished Product: Gold or Gilt?

### Shine

Once dry, Balthasar Gold has a subtle yet pleasing shine. It's not blindingly reflective, but it catches the light nicely, giving your miniature a rich, warm glow. Perfect for armor, weaponry, or making your space marines look like they've just returned from a luxurious vacation in the 41st millennium.

### Durability

In terms of durability, the paint holds up well to handling and minor bumps. However, if you're someone who likes to throw your miniatures around like dice, you might need to touch up those golden bits more frequently.

## Comparing to Other Gold Paints

Of course, Balthasar Gold isn't the only gold paint on the market. There are alternatives, like Vallejo Gold and P3 Brass Balls. How does it stack up?

### Vallejo Gold

Vallejo Gold offers a slightly brighter finish but requires more layers for full coverage. If you have the patience of a saint, this might be your go-to.

### P3 Brass Balls

P3 Brass Balls is comparable in terms of coverage but has a cooler tone. Great for steampunk designs but might not give you the warm glow you're looking for in traditional fantasy settings.

## Conclusion: Should You Buy Balthasar Gold?

If you're looking for a reliable gold paint that offers a warm, subtle shine, Citadel Balthasar Gold is a solid choice. It's not perfect, but it's versatile and durable enough for most projects. Plus, it's Citadel, so you can show off your collection and pretend you're a professional hobbyist.

Tamiya weathering master is a great choice for those who need versatile weathering effects. However, it doesn't offer the same precision and matte finish that the Mitsubishi markers do.

### [Vallejo Model Color](https://acrylicosvallejo.com/en/product-category/model-color/)
Vallejo offers a wide range of colors and is known for its quality. While it's excellent for brush application, it lacks the precision and ease of use of the Mitsubishi markers.

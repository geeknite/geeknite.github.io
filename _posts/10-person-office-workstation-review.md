The 5 Person Office Workstation is a compact alternative. It's great for smaller teams but lacks the space and privacy of the 10 Person version. If you're low on space or budget, this might be a better fit【4:1†source】.

### [20 Person Office Workstation]({%- post_url 2025-07-24-20-person-office-workstation-review -%})

The 20 Person Office Workstation is the giant of office furniture. It's perfect for large teams but requires an office the size of a football field. It's more expensive and harder to manage. Only consider it if you're running a tech giant【4:1†source】.

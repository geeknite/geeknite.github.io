## The Basics

### What is Stuka Leader Core Game?

Stuka Leader Core Game is a solo strategy game where players take on the role of a Luftwaffe commander during World War II. Your mission: lead your squadron of Stuka dive bombers to victory against enemy forces. Think of it as being the overlord of chaos, but with a lot more paperwork (and hopefully less screaming).

### Components

The game comes with:
- **Game Board**: Depicting various wartime locations and strategic points.
- **Miniatures**: Beautifully designed Stuka dive bombers and enemy units.
- **Cards**: Representing missions, events, and special abilities.
- **Tokens and Markers**: Used to track progress, resources, and damage.

**Pro Tip**: Don't let your cat near the miniatures. Those claws are worse than enemy anti-aircraft guns.

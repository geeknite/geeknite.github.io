Hey Geeknite readers! Remember the GoPro Hero4 Black? Yeah, that old gem your dad probably used to record birthday parties and pretend he was a pro filmmaker. Well, we're taking a trip down memory lane to see if this action camera still holds up in the year 2025. Spoiler alert: it's not the worst thing you could strap to your helmet!

## Design and Build Quality

The GoPro Hero4 Black boasts a rugged, waterproof design that screams "I'm ready for action!" It's compact, durable, and can withstand a beating. If you accidentally drop it while doing tricks on your skateboard or fail to mount it properly on your bike, fear not! This little beast can take it like a champ.

One downside? It looks like it hasn't aged a day since it was launched—literally. If you want to look like you're rocking the latest tech, this might not be the camera for you. But if vintage vibes are your thing, go for it!

## Performance and Features

### Video Quality

The Hero4 Black can shoot up to 4K at 30fps, which was mind-blowing back when it was released. Today, it's still pretty decent, but don't expect it to compete with newer models that boast higher resolutions and frame rates. If you're all about capturing your dog doing backflips in ultra-HD, consider upgrading.

### Photo Quality

With 12MP photos, the Hero4 Black holds its own in the photography department. Your selfies might not be billboard-worthy, but they'll definitely be Facebook and Instagram-approved. Plus, the wide-angle lens lets you capture more of those epic landscapes.

### Battery Life

The Hero4 Black's battery life is mediocre at best. You might find yourself carrying extra batteries or a portable charger on your adventures. Pro tip: don't plan on recording your entire skydiving experience unless you've got backup power.

## Usability

While the Hero4 Black's interface isn't the most user-friendly, it's manageable. The tiny screen can be a bit of a pain, especially if you're trying to adjust settings mid-action. You'll probably end up fiddling with it like an old TV remote.

## Audio Quality

The built-in microphone is... well, let's just say it gets the job done. If you're planning to capture crystal-clear audio, do yourself a favor and invest in an external mic. Otherwise, enjoy the muffled sound of your thrilling escapades.

## Connectivity

Say goodbye to seamless wireless transfers. The Hero4 Black's Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity are decent but far from speedy. You'll spend more time trying to connect to your devices than actually transferring files. Patience is key, my friends.

## Comparison with Other Action Cameras

### [GoPro Hero10 Black]({%- post_url 2023-07-04-prime-day-bike-gadgets-accesories -%})
The Hero10 Black offers stunning 5.3K video, advanced stabilization, and 23MP photos, making it a top choice for action enthusiasts. It's like comparing a flip phone to a smartphone—no contest.

### [DJI Osmo Action]({%- post_url 2023-07-04-prime-day-bike-gadgets-accesories -%})
The Osmo Action shoots in 4K and has a front-facing screen for easy framing. It's a worthy competitor to the newer GoPro models, but the Hero4 Black simply can't keep up.

### [Eken H9]({%- post_url 2017-01-02-h9-action-cam-review-primeras-impresiones -%})
A budget-friendly action camera that's surprisingly good for its price. It's a great alternative if you're looking to spend less while still capturing decent footage.

## Funny Quirks

Now, for the fun part. The Hero4 Black has a few quirks that might make you chuckle—or pull your hair out.

- **Random Freezes**: It occasionally freezes at the most inconvenient times. Whether you're mid-jump or trying to capture your cat's latest antics, be prepared for a few frustrating moments.
- **Overheating**: Using it for extended periods can turn it into a mini heater. Nothing says "I'm an action hero" like a camera that's too hot to handle.
- **Firmware Updates**: These can be a hit or miss. Sometimes they improve functionality, and other times they leave you wondering if you accidentally installed a potato.

## Our Verdict

Is the GoPro Hero4 Black still worth it in 2025? If you're on a tight budget or just feeling nostalgic, it's a solid choice. However, if you're serious about capturing high-quality footage, consider upgrading to a newer model. The Hero4 Black is like the vintage car of action cameras—classic and reliable, but not exactly cutting-edge.

# Adidas Own The Run: Mallas Running Hombre Negro

Hello Geeknite readers! Today we are diving headfirst into the world of running tights with a review of the **Adidas Own The Run Mallas Running Hombre Negro**. If you thought choosing running gear was as easy as picking a flavor of ice cream, think again! This review will break down everything you need to know about these tights, and maybe make you chuckle along the way.

## First Impressions

Let's start with the looks. These mallas scream "I'm serious about my running, but I also enjoy looking like a ninja." The black color is sleek and stylish, perfect for those who want to look like they're running away from their responsibilities in style.

## Features

### Comfort

These tights are designed with comfort in mind. The fabric is soft and stretchy, hugging your legs like a clingy ex who just won't let go. The waistband is snug but not too tight, ensuring that your mid-run burrito doesn't make a surprise appearance.

### Breathability

The material is breathable, which is a fancy way of saying it lets your legs breathe. This is crucial for those long runs where you don't want your legs to feel like they're trapped in a sauna.

### Durability

Durability is where these tights shine. Adidas has made sure that these mallas can withstand the test of time—and the test of your washing machine. No more worrying about them turning into capris after a few washes!

## Performance

### Running

During our test runs, the Adidas Own The Run Mallas performed exceptionally well. They provided great support without being restrictive, making you feel like you could run forever or at least until your playlist ran out of songs.

### Other Activities

These tights are not just for running. They're perfect for yoga, pilates, or even binge-watching your favorite series on the couch. Versatility is their middle name!

## Price

At around $60, these tights are a bit of an investment, but can you really put a price on looking and feeling great while you run? We think not. Plus, consider how many compliments you'll get from fellow runners. Totally worth it.

## The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly

### The Good

- **Comfortable Fit**: Soft, stretchy, and hugs you like your grandma at Christmas.
- **Breathable**: Keeps your legs cool even during intense runs.
- **Durable**: Built to last, these tights can withstand countless runs and washes.

### The Bad

- **Pricey**: At $60, they might be out of reach for some budget-conscious runners.

### The Ugly

- **Limited Color Options**: If black isn't your thing, you're out of luck.

## Comparison with Other Models

### Nike Pro Tights

The Nike Pro Tights are a great alternative, offering similar comfort and breathability. However, they come in various colors, which might be a plus for those who want to express themselves while running.

### Under Armour HeatGear Compression Leggings

These leggings offer excellent compression and support, making them great for recovery runs. However, they might not be as breathable as the Adidas Own The Run Mallas.

## Final Recommendation

If you're looking for a pair of running tights that offer comfort, breathability, and durability, the **Adidas Own The Run Mallas Running Hombre Negro** are a fantastic choice. They might be a bit pricey, but the investment is worth it for the performance boost and the compliments you'll get on your ninja-like appearance.

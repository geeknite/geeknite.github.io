These rugged miners turned magical enforcers are ready to crush their foes and make the Arcanists proud. So grab your pickaxe and your spellbook, because we're going to unearth the secrets of this powerhouse unit!

## Who Are the Slate Ridge Suppressors?

The Slate Ridge Suppressors are a unit in the Arcanists faction for Malifaux 3rd Edition. Known for their resilience and brute strength, these miners are not only adept at breaking rocks, but they're also quite skilled at breaking enemy faces. With their high defense and impressive attack capabilities, they're a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield.

## Abilities and Stats

### Defensive Stats

- **Defense:** 6. Because who needs fancy armor when you've got muscles and a bad attitude?
- **Willpower:** 5. They might not be the brightest, but they're tough enough to resist most magical attacks.
- **Wounds:** 8. That's right, eight wounds. These guys can take a beating and still keep coming at you.

### Offensive Stats

- **Melee Attack:** 6. Their pickaxes are not just for mining, you know.
- **Ranged Attack:** 5. They can throw rocks with surprising accuracy.
- **Damage:** 2/3/4. A respectable damage spread that ensures your enemies will feel the pain.

### Special Abilities

- **Hard to Kill:** When they would be reduced to 1 wound, they aren't. Because they're just too stubborn to die.
- **Armor +1:** They might be shirtless, but they're still tougher than a refrigerator.
- **Mining Tools:** They get a bonus to their attack rolls when using their trusty pickaxes.

## Tactics and Strategies

### Crushing Your Foes

The Slate Ridge Suppressors are best used as frontline attackers. Their high defense and armor make them difficult to take down, allowing them to soak up damage while dishing it out. Pair them with a support unit that can heal or buff them, and you've got yourself an unstoppable force.

### Mining for Victory

These guys excel in scenarios that require holding ground or controlling objectives. Their toughness allows them to stay put and resist enemy attempts to dislodge them. Use their mining tools to clear out enemy models and secure key positions on the battlefield.

### Throwing Rocks

Don't underestimate their ranged attack. If you need to soften up an enemy before charging in, their rock-throwing skills come in handy. Plus, it's always fun to imagine your opponent's reaction to being pummeled by flying stones.

## Comparison with Other Units

### vs. Gunsmiths

While Gunsmiths offer higher ranged damage and versatility, they lack the sheer toughness of the Slate Ridge Suppressors. If you need a unit to hold the line and bash heads, the Suppressors are your go-to choice.

### vs. Ice Gamin

Ice Gamin have magical attacks and elemental abilities, but they can't match the raw physical power and resilience of the Slate Ridge Suppressors. For straightforward smash-and-grab tactics, the Suppressors win hands down.

## Conclusion

The **Slate Ridge Suppressors** are an excellent addition to any Arcanists crew. Their combination of high defense, respectable attack, and special abilities make them versatile and formidable on the battlefield. Whether you're new to Malifaux or a seasoned veteran, these miners will provide you with the muscle and toughness you need to dominate your opponents.

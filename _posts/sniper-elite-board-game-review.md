## The Basics

### What is Sniper Elite Board Game?

The Sniper Elite Board Game is a hidden movement and strategy game based on the popular video game series, Sniper Elite. Designed by David Thompson and Roger Tankersley, this game captures the essence of the digital experience, allowing players to engage in intense stealth missions on the tabletop. One player takes on the role of the elite sniper, while others control the German soldiers attempting to thwart the sniper's mission.

### Components

The game comes with a beautifully designed board, depicting various wartime locations, and high-quality miniatures, representing both the sniper and the German soldiers. The detailed artwork and sturdy components ensure an immersive gaming experience. Additionally, the game includes various tokens, cards, and a rulebook that's surprisingly easy to understand â€“ a rare gem in the board gaming world.

## Gameplay

### Setting Up

Setup is straightforward. The sniper player secretly plans their moves on a hidden board, while the German soldiers are positioned on the main board. The objective for the sniper is to complete their mission objectives without being detected, while the soldiers must work together to locate and capture the sniper.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, the sniper moves stealthily across the board, using various actions to avoid detection, such as moving quietly, creating distractions, or taking out guards with silent kills. The soldiers, on the other hand, move and search based on limited information, trying to predict the sniper's movements and set traps.

### Stealth and Strategy

The game shines in its strategic depth. As the sniper, you must carefully plan your moves, utilize cover, and think several steps ahead to outwit the soldiers. For the soldier players, cooperation and deduction are key. You'll need to communicate effectively, share information, and anticipate the sniper's tactics to corner them successfully.

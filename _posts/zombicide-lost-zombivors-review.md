### The Basics

In Zombicide: Lost Zombivors, players work together to complete missions while fending off waves of zombies. Each player controls a unique survivor, each with special abilities and cards. The goal is to complete objectives, defeat zombies, and avoid becoming a zombivor (a zombie survivor).

### Components

The game comes with:
- **Miniatures**: Beautifully crafted miniatures of your favorite zombie apocalypse characters. Seriously, they're so detailed you might want to display them proudly on your shelf.
- **Cards**: Each survivor has a deck of cards representing their abilities, actions, and special powers.
- **Game Board**: Various locations from the post-apocalyptic world where battles and missions take place.
- **Tokens and Markers**: Used to track progress, health, and various effects during the game.

**Pro Tip**: Don't let your cat near the miniatures. Those claws are the real supervillains.

## How to Play

## Introduction

Welcome, zombie enthusiasts! Today, we're diving headfirst into the world of **Zombicide: Lost Zombivors**. If you've ever thought, "I need more zombies in my life," then grab your machete and shotgun, because this review is for you. Prepare for an epic quest filled with brain-eating fun, survival stress, and a sprinkle of absurdity.

## The Basics

### What is Zombicide: Lost Zombivors?

Zombicide: Lost Zombivors is an expansion to the base Zombicide series, adding new elements, characters, and scenarios to the game. This expansion introduces the concept of "Zombivors," which are zombie survivors that have turned into brain-hungry creatures. It's like your favorite character got a new job offer – but instead of a promotion, they got an insatiable appetite for brains.

### Components

The game comes with a plethora of beautifully designed miniatures, new tiles, and a deck of cards that will make any Zombicide fan drool. The components are top-notch and add a creepy yet hilarious vibe to the game. Plus, the heroes and Zombivors look so good, you might want to display them on your desk (just don't let your boss know).

**Fun Fact**: The Zombivors come with their own unique abilities, making them more challenging (and fun) to deal with.

## Gameplay

### Setup

Setting up Zombicide: Lost Zombivors is as thrilling as deciding what toppings to put on your zombie pizza. Lay out the tiles, place the miniatures, shuffle the cards, and you're ready to roll. The setup is relatively straightforward, but don't be surprised if you feel an eerie excitement as you prepare for the impending zombie apocalypse.

### Turn Phases

Each turn consists of several phases:

1. **Action Phase**: Players perform actions like moving, attacking, and using special abilities.
2. **Event Phase**: Draw event cards that introduce new challenges or spawn more zombies (because why not?).
3. **Zombie Phase**: Zombies move and attack, causing chaos and mayhem. Prepare for brain-eating madness!

### Winning and Losing

To win, players must complete all objectives before the zombie invasion becomes too overwhelming. If the heroes are defeated or the zombie infestation reaches critical levels, it's game over. Sorry, humanity.

**Pro Tip**: Keep your "Zombie Repellent" card handy. It may not save you, but it will give you a fighting chance.

The game embraces the ridiculousness of a zombie apocalypse, and you'll find yourself laughing as much as strategizing.

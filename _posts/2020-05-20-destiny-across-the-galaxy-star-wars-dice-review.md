### Funny Moment

During one game night, we decided to roll the dice to determine who would make the next snack run. The dice decided it should be Chewbacca. Unfortunately, Chewbacca (aka my friend Joe) didn't fit too well into the local grocery store. Lesson learned: maybe let Chewbacca stick to the Millennium Falcon.

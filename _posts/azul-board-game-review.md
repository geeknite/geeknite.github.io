## What is Azul?

Azul is a beautifully crafted tile-placement game where players take on the role of tile-laying artisans tasked with creating the most beautiful mosaic in the Royal Palace of Evora. The game is designed by Michael Kiesling and published by Plan B Games. It's a game of strategy, planning, and a touch of luck, making it a favorite among board game enthusiasts.

## Components and Quality

Azul comes with high-quality components that are both visually stunning and satisfying to handle. The game includes:

- 100 resin tiles in five different colors
- 4 player boards
- 9 factory displays
- A score track board
- A cloth bag for tiles

The tiles are sturdy and have a nice weight to them, making them feel premium. The artwork is colorful and detailed, adding to the overall aesthetic appeal of the game.

## Gameplay

### Setup

Setting up Azul is a breeze. Each player receives a player board and places the factory displays in the center of the table. Tiles are drawn from the bag and placed on the displays. The game is ready to begin in just a few minutes.

### How to Play

Azul is played over multiple rounds, with each round consisting of three phases:

1. **Drafting Tiles:** Players take turns selecting tiles from the factory displays and placing them on their player board. You must take all tiles of the same color from a display and move any remaining tiles to the center.
2. **Arranging Tiles:** Once all tiles are drafted, players move the tiles from their player board to their mosaic. Tiles must be placed following specific placement rules, and points are scored based on tile placement.
3. **Preparing for Next Round:** Players draw new tiles from the bag and refill the factory displays for the next round.

### Scoring

Scoring in Azul is straightforward but requires strategic thinking. Points are awarded for placing tiles, completing rows and columns, and creating patterns. Penalties are given for unused tiles, adding a layer of decision-making to each move.

## Strategy Tips

- **Plan Ahead:** Think several moves ahead to maximize your points and avoid penalties. Pay attention to your opponents' boards and anticipate their moves.
- **Balance:** Maintain a balance between completing rows and columns and creating patterns. Both strategies are crucial for scoring high points.
- **Adapt:** Be ready to adapt your strategy based on the tiles available and your opponents' actions. Flexibility is key to winning.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- **Beautiful Components:** The tiles and artwork are visually stunning and enhance the gaming experience.

- **Strategic Depth:** Despite its simplicity, Azul offers a deep level of strategy that keeps players engaged.

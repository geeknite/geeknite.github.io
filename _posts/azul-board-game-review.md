## Introduction

Welcome back, Geeknite enthusiasts! Today, we're diving into the vibrant and strategic world of **Azul**, the board game that’s as visually appealing as it is intellectually stimulating. If you’ve ever dreamed of being a master tile-layer without the back-breaking labor, Azul is your jam. Grab your grout and let’s get started!

## What is Azul?

Azul is a tile-laying game designed by Michael Kiesling and published by Plan B Games. The game centers around drafting tiles and placing them on your board to score points. The catch? You need to carefully select tiles to maximize your scoring while sabotaging your opponents’ plans. It’s like being a diabolical interior designer.

## Components and Quality

The components of Azul are nothing short of gorgeous. You get colorful, chunky tiles that feel satisfying to play with. The game boards are sturdy and well-designed, ensuring they survive even the most intense gaming sessions. The quality of the pieces makes it feel like you’re working on a miniature mosaic masterpiece. It’s like Tile-Laying ASMR.

### Pros:

- **Stunning Visuals**: The tiles are so pretty, you might be tempted to use them as home decor.
- **High-Quality Components**: Durable and satisfying to handle.
- **Easy-to-Learn Rules**: Straightforward gameplay that even your grandma can understand.

### Cons:

- **Tile Envy**: You’ll feel a pang of jealousy every time your opponent drafts the tile you wanted.

## Gameplay Mechanics

Azul’s gameplay revolves around drafting tiles from a central market and placing them on your player board. The goal is to create patterns and complete rows and columns to score points. The game ends when at least one player completes a row on their board.

### Drafting Tiles

Each round, players take turns selecting tiles from factory displays or the center pool. You can only take tiles of the same color from a display, and any leftover tiles go to the center pool, which can become a chaotic heap of discarded dreams.

### Placing Tiles

Once you’ve drafted your tiles, you place them on your player board. You need to complete rows and columns to score points, with bonuses for completing sets of the same color or filling specific areas. The trick is planning your moves to block opponents while optimizing your score.

### Scoring

Scoring in Azul is a delicate balance of strategy and foresight. You score points for placing tiles, completing rows and columns, and achieving specific patterns. There are also penalties for leftover tiles, so draft wisely or face the wrath of negative points.

## Strategy Tips

### 1. **Plan Ahead**

Think several moves ahead and anticipate which tiles will be available. Try to block your opponents while maximizing your own scoring opportunities.

### 2. **Diversify Your Patterns**

Don’t focus solely on one type of pattern. Mix up your strategy to keep opponents guessing and reduce the risk of getting stuck with unusable tiles.

### 3. **Watch Your Opponents**

Keep an eye on your opponents’ boards and draft tiles that disrupt their plans. Sometimes the best move is one that prevents your opponent from scoring big.

## Comparing Azul to Other Games

In the realm of tile-laying games, Azul stands out for its simplicity and depth. Unlike games that require extensive setup or complex rules, Azul gets players into the action quickly. The puzzle-like nature of tile placement creates those satisfying “aha!” moments when everything clicks into place, similar to what makes [adult board gaming]({%- post_url 2019-11-15-adult-board-games -%}) so rewarding for grown-ups.

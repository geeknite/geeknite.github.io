## Introduction

Hello there, Star Wars aficionados and Funko POP! enthusiasts! Today, we're diving into the galaxy far, far away to review the **Funko POP! Star Wars: The Mandalorian - Darth Maul** collectible. If you've ever wanted a chibi version of one of the most menacing Sith Lords on your shelf, buckle up—it's going to be a fun ride!

## Design and Details

### The Look

First things first—let's talk about the design. This Funko POP! figure captures Darth Maul in all his glory, complete with his iconic red and black face tattoos, sinister yellow eyes, and, of course, the double-bladed lightsaber. The detail on the face tattoos is impressive for a figure of this size, and the lightsaber is just the cherry on top.

### The Pose

Darth Maul is posed in a battle-ready stance, looking like he's about to start a duel with Obi-Wan Kenobi (again). The pose is dynamic and adds a sense of movement to the figure, which is a welcome change from some of the more static Funko POP! designs.

### The Build Quality

The build quality is solid, as expected from Funko. The figure feels sturdy and well-made. The paint job is clean, with no noticeable smudges or errors. The lightsaber is made of a slightly flexible material, so you don't have to worry about it snapping off easily.

## Packaging

The packaging is the standard Funko POP! box with a clear window, so you can admire Darth Maul without taking him out of the box (if you're one of those collectors). The box features Star Wars: The Mandalorian branding, which is a nice touch and makes it clear that this is a special edition figure.

## What is SHADE: AGRAX EARTHSHADE?

For the uninitiated, **Agrax Earthshade** is a wash produced by Games Workshop. It's designed to flow into the recesses of your miniature, creating depth, shadows, and a delightful dirty effect that makes your tiny warriors look like they've just crawled out of a swamp. It's essentially liquid talent in a bottle.

## The Application Process

### Step 1: Shake it like a Polaroid Picture

Before you even think about applying **Agrax Earthshade**, give that bottle a good shake. Seriously, shake it like you're trying to wake up a sleeping dragon. The pigment tends to settle at the bottom, and unless you want a watery mess, this step is crucial.

### Step 2: The Dirty Dip

Once your shade is thoroughly mixed, it's time for the fun part. Take a brush, preferably one you don't mind sacrificing to the shade gods, and dip it into the bottle. The consistency should be perfect – not too thick, not too thin, but just right. Now, slather it all over your miniature like you're finger painting in kindergarten.

## The Results

### Pros

- **Instant Depth**: Agrax Earthshade works wonders in adding depth to your miniature. It flows effortlessly into the crevices, making details pop like a 3D movie.
- **Versatile**: Whether you're painting grimdark soldiers or shiny elves, this shade adapts to any style.
- **Easy to Use**: Even if you have the artistic talent of a potato, Agrax Earthshade makes it look like you know what you're doing.

### Cons

- **The Shine**: One downside is the glossy finish it leaves behind. Your miniature might end up looking like it's covered in sweat. A matte varnish can solve this, but it's an extra step.
- **Overuse**: It's easy to get carried away. Too much shade can turn your masterpiece into a muddy disaster. Less is definitely more.

## Funny Mishaps

Let's face it – we've all had our share of **Agrax Earthshade** mishaps. Here are a few classics:

- **The Spill**: That heart-stopping moment when you knock over your bottle of shade. Suddenly, your workspace looks like a crime scene, and your miniatures are bathing in liquid talent.
- **The Overload**: You've just finished painting a pristine miniature. One dip too many in the **Agrax Earthshade** and now it looks like a swamp monster. Oops.

## Conclusion

**SHADE: AGRAX EARTHSHADE** is a staple for miniature painters, and for good reason. Despite its few quirks, its ability to add depth, shadow, and character to your miniatures is unmatched. It's the secret sauce of the painting world, and once you start using it, you'll wonder how you ever painted without it.

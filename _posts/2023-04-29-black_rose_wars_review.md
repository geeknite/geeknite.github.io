## What is Black Rose Wars?

Black Rose Wars is a tactical deck-building game for 2-4 players created by Ludus Magnus Studio. Players assume the roles of powerful mages battling for control of the Black Rose, a powerful artifact that grants ultimate power. The game is set in a dark and magical universe with intricate miniatures and stunning artwork that will make any geek's heart flutter.

### Components

The game comes packed with:
- High-quality miniatures of mages and summoned creatures
- A modular game board representing the Black Rose Lodge
- Hundreds of beautifully illustrated spell cards
- Various tokens and markers to keep track of your magical mayhem

**Pro Tip**: Try not to let your cat near the board. They've been known to have a vendetta against beautifully arranged components.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up Black Rose Wars is like preparing for a wizard duel at Hogwarts. Lay out the modular board, distribute spell cards, and choose your mage. Make sure you have plenty of snacks, because this game is a marathon, not a sprint.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn in Black Rose Wars is divided into several phases:
1. **Preparation Phase**: Draw new spell cards and prepare your hand.
2. **Action Phase**: Move around the board, cast spells, and summon creatures.
3. **Event Phase**: Resolve events that can alter the course of the game.
4. **Cleanup Phase**: Reset for the next round.

The goal is to earn the most power points by completing objectives, defeating opponents, and controlling rooms in the Black Rose Lodge. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins and becomes the Supreme Mage.

One of the highlights of Black Rose Wars is the deep and strategic spell-casting system. With hundreds of spells to choose from, players can create unique combos and devastating attacks.

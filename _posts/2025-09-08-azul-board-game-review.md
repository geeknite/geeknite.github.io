## What is Azul?

Azul is a beautiful board game designed by Michael Kiesling and published by Plan B Games. The game is inspired by the intricate and colorful tile designs found in the Royal Palace of Evora, Portugal. Players take turns drafting tiles from a central market and placing them on their personal boards to create stunning mosaics.

## How to Play Azul

### Setup

Setting up Azul is as simple as making a PB&J sandwich (minus the mess). Each player gets a board, and the central market is filled with lovely tiles. Here's a quick breakdown:

1. **Place the Factory Displays**: Arrange the factory displays in a circle.
2. **Fill the Factories**: Draw tiles from the bag and place them in factories (4 tiles each).
3. **Give Each Player a Board**: Hand out the player boards and scoring tokens.
4. **Prepare the Starting Player Marker**: Determine who gets to be the first player (hint: it involves rock-paper-scissors).

### Gameplay

The game consists of drafting tiles, placing them on your board, and scoring points. The goal is to create beautiful mosaics while adhering to specific placement rules. Here's how it works:

1. **Drafting Tiles**: Players take turns selecting tiles from the factory displays or the central market.
2. **Placing Tiles**: Place the selected tiles in a row on your player board. Excess tiles break and cost you points.
3. **Scoring**: At the end of each round, score points based on the tiles placed.
4. **Endgame**: The game ends when at least one player completes a horizontal row.

## Strategies and Tips

### Plan Ahead

Azul rewards careful planning and foresight. Make sure to draft tiles that will help you complete rows and columns while maximizing your points. Don't be that player who drafts tiles like they're picking out random socks in the dark.

### Watch Your Opponents

Keep an eye on your opponents' boards and avoid giving them tiles that will help them too much. If you see them getting close to completing a row, snag those tiles to thwart their plans. It's like stealing candy from a baby, but with tiles.

### Deal with Broken Tiles

Sometimes you'll end up with more tiles than you can place, resulting in broken tiles. Try to minimize this by planning your drafts carefully. Broken tiles might cost you points, but hey, everyone loves a challenge.

## Azul vs. Other Tile-Laying Games

### Azul vs. Sagrada

Both Azul and Sagrada are tile-laying games with a focus on creating beautiful patterns. However, Azul's gameplay is more straightforward and accessible, making it a great choice for both casual and hardcore gamers. Sagrada, on the other hand, involves dice and more complex rules, adding an extra layer of strategy.

### Azul vs. Patchwork

Patchwork is another popular tile-laying game, but with a quilting theme. While Patchwork involves a unique time track mechanic, Azul focuses on drafting and placement. Both games are fantastic, but if you're a fan of mosaic art, Azul will probably win your heart.

## Final Verdict

Azul is a mesmerizing and strategic board game that offers hours of fun for players of all skill levels. Its simple rules and beautiful components make it a must-have for any board game collection. Whether you're a seasoned gamer or just looking for a new way to spend your weekends, Azul has something to offer.

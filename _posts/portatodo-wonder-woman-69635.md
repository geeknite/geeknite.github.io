Wonder Woman is known for her strength, and it seems her merchandise is too. The polyester material is tough enough to withstand the rough and tumble of daily life. We've tossed it, dropped it, and even tried using it as a makeshift batarang (not recommended). It survived with barely a scratch.

We compared the Portatodo Wonder Woman 69635 with other pencil cases from the Geeknite archives, like the **Portabidones Zéfal Wiiz**【4:0†source】and the **PS5 on eBay**【4:2†source】.

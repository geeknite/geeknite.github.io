Welcome back, miniature painting enthusiasts! Today, we’re diving into the wonderful world of Citadel Shade: Reikland Fleshshade. Whether you’re a fresh-faced newbie or a grizzled veteran of the painting wars, this review will have something for everyone. So grab your brushes, sit back, and let's get shaded!

## What is Reikland Fleshshade?

For those unfamiliar with the sheer genius of Citadel’s shade line, Reikland Fleshshade is a wash—a thin paint that settles into the recesses of your miniature's details. It's like makeup, but for your Orcs. This particular shade is fabulous for skin tones, giving your minis that extra depth and definition. It’s also known for turning your miniatures into dramatic Shakespearean actors at the drop of a hat.

## Application and Ease of Use

Applying Reikland Fleshshade is as easy as pie. Simply load up your brush, slap it on your mini, and watch the magic happen. It flows into crevices like water seeking the lowest point—except more colorful and less likely to cause mold.

However, one must be cautious. Like an overzealous housewife with a bottle of Febreze, too much Fleshshade can drown your mini in a sea of reddish-brown despair. Moderation is key, folks.

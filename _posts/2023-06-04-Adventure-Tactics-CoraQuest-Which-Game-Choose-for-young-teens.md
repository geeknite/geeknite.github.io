**Hey there, fellow adventurers!** Are you ready for some epic dungeon-crawling and tactical combat? Then you need to check out [Adventure Tactics]({{ site.constants.wsib }}adventure tactics) and [CoraQuest]({{ site.constants.wsib }}coraquest). These two games offer unique twists on the classic adventure board game genre that will keep you and your kids on the edge of your seat. We already discussed [why board gaming is good for adults]({%- post_url 2019-11-15-adult-board-games -%}), but today letâ€™s focus on young teens.

## CoraQuest: The Creative, Kid-Friendly Dungeon Crawler

Let's start with [CoraQuest]({{ site.constants.wsib }}coraquest). As someone who's not very imaginative and doesn't have much time to prep before playing with kids, I love that it doesn't require a DM. Plus, the artwork is simply wonderful and the premade heroes and quests are top-notch. And the best part? It uses terms that are in line with adult RPGs, so your kid will be learning concepts of games they'll be playing later in life. The component quality is also fantastic, except for the rule book which is fairly flimsy and can't handle being handled by a 7-year-old all afternoon.

One of the things I love about [CoraQuest]({{ site.constants.wsib }}coraquest) is the fast-paced card-based combat. You'll be upgrading your characters and unlocking new abilities and weapons as you progress through the game. It's like a video game, but without the screen. This leveling system adds a layer of excitement and anticipation to the game, as you work towards *unlocking new abilities and defeating tougher monsters*. It's perfect for those who enjoy leveling up and unlocking new abilities, making the pre- and post-game experience of [CoraQuest]({{ site.constants.wsib }}coraquest) incredibly engaging.

However, the actual gameplay can sometimes feel a bit repetitive and unbalanced. There are some variations in the battles, but they mostly feel very same-y and also unbalanced. The beginning of the game was very hard and I defeated my last two scenarios on the first or second round - just too easy. But, hold on, there's a silver lining! There are expansions coming out that are supposed to (a) add more variety and (b) balance the game. For me, that can change this from a good game to a great game.

Now, let's talk about [Adventure Tactics]({{ site.constants.wsib }}adventure tactics). This game allows you to customize your characters with different abilities and equipment, making each playthrough a unique experience. But what really sets it apart is the branching story system.

It's perfect for those who enjoy tactical combat and character customization.

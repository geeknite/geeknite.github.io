All aboard! Welcome to the whimsical world of **Isle of Trains: All Aboard**, a game that combines strategic depth with simple joys. Whether you're an avid board gamer or someone who just enjoys the occasional game night, this charming title is sure to keep your engine running.

## **Overview**

**Isle of Trains: All Aboard** is a delightful strategy game where players take on the roles of train conductors, competing to build the most efficient and prosperous railway network. Designed by Seth Jaffee and Dan Keltner, this game combines card drafting, resource management, and a touch of worker placement in a beautifully illustrated package.

### **Components and Quality**

The game comes with a variety of components, including:

- High-quality cards depicting various train cars, stations, and locomotives.
- A set of colorful wooden train meeples.
- Resource tokens representing coal, wood, and other goods.
- A beautifully illustrated game board that captures the essence of a bustling train network.

**Criticism Alert**: While the components are of high quality, the small size of the resource tokens can make them fiddly to handle, especially during intense gameplay sessions.

## **Gameplay Mechanics**

At its core, **Isle of Trains: All Aboard** is about building a well-oiled train network. Players draft cards to build train cars and stations, manage resources to complete deliveries, and strategically place workers to gain advantages.

### **Building Your Train**

Each player starts with a basic locomotive and a handful of cards. Throughout the game, players will draft additional train cars to attach to their locomotives. These cars provide various benefits, such as additional storage for resources, special abilities, or points at the end of the game.

**Pro Tip**: Diversify your train cars early on. Having a mix of storage, abilities, and point-generating cars can give you the flexibility to adapt to different strategies.

### **Resource Management**

Resources are the lifeblood of your railway empire. Players collect resources through various means, including drafting cards, placing workers on resource-generating spots, and completing deliveries. Managing these resources efficiently is key to success.

### **Worker Placement**

The worker placement mechanic adds a layer of strategy to the game. Players can place their workers on various spots on the board to gain resources, build train cars, or gain other advantages. Timing and placement are crucial, as the best spots can be hotly contested.

**Funny Moment**: During one game, a player placed their worker on a resource spot, only to realize they had no storage space left on their train. The resulting scramble to rearrange their train cars had everyone at the table in stitches.

### **Deliveries and Scoring**

Completing deliveries is one of the main ways to score points. Players must manage their resources and train cars to fulfill delivery contracts, which provide points and other benefits. The game ends when a certain number of deliveries have been completed, and the player with the most points wins.

## **Pros and Cons**

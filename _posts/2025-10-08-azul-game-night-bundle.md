## Introduction

Welcome, fellow board game geeks! Today, we're diving into the vibrant and intricate world of **Azul: Game Night Bundle**. If you love tile-laying games that are as visually appealing as they are strategically challenging, Azul promises to be your new obsession. Prepare for a night filled with beautiful tiles, careful planning, and possibly some friendly banter.

## What is Azul: Game Night Bundle?

Azul: Game Night Bundle is a collection of Azul games, each offering a unique twist on the original tile-laying concept. This bundle includes:

- **Azul**: The classic game where players compete to create the most aesthetically pleasing mosaic using colorful tiles.
- **Azul: Stained Glass of Sintra**: A variant where players create stunning stained glass windows.
- **Azul: Summer Pavilion**: Another variant focusing on creating intricate patterns with pavilion tiles.

### The Basics

In each Azul game, players take turns drafting tiles from a central market and placing them onto their personal boards. The goal is to create patterns and sequences that score the maximum points while blocking your opponents from doing the same.

### Components

The Game Night Bundle comes with:
- **Tiles**: Gorgeous, chunky tiles in various colors and designs. Seriously, they're so pretty you might want to use them as coasters.
- **Boards**: Each variant has a distinct board with unique rules and patterns.
- **Tokens and Markers**: Used to track scores and progress during the game.

**Pro Tip**: Keep snacks away from the tiles. Those nachos are the real game night villains.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up Azul is like preparing an art exhibition. Lay out the tiles, distribute boards, and get ready to draft. Now you're ready to become a master mosaic artist.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players draft tiles from the market and place them on their boards. The challenge lies in drafting the right tiles and placing them strategically to maximize points.

### Scoring

Scoring in Azul is a blend of strategy and foresight. Players earn points for completing rows, columns, and specific patterns. Did you plan an epic sequence just to have your opponent snatch the tiles you needed? Welcome to the world of Azul, where every choice ripples through the game.

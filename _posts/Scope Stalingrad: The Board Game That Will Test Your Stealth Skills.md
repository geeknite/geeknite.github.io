## The Basics

### What is Scope Stalingrad?

Scope Stalingrad is a hidden movement and strategy game set during the Battle of Stalingrad in World War II. Designed to capture the essence of stealth and strategy, this game allows players to engage in intense sniper missions. One player takes on the role of the elite sniper, while others control the soldiers attempting to thwart the sniper's objectives.

### Components

The game comes with a beautifully designed board depicting various wartime locations and high-quality miniatures representing both the sniper and the soldiers. The detailed artwork and sturdy components ensure an immersive gaming experience. Additionally, the game includes various tokens, cards, and a rulebook that's surprisingly easy to understand—a rare gem in the board gaming world.

## Gameplay

### Setting Up

Setup is straightforward. The sniper player secretly plans their moves on a hidden board, while the soldiers are positioned on the main board. The objective for the sniper is to complete their mission objectives without being detected, while the soldiers must work together to locate and capture the sniper.

### Turn Phases

Each turn consists of several phases:

1. **Action Phase**: Players perform actions like moving, attacking, and using special abilities.
2. **Event Phase**: Draw event cards that introduce new challenges or spawn more enemies. (Because why not?)
3. **Enemy Phase**: Enemies move and attack. Prepare for chaos!

### Stealth and Strategy

The game shines in its strategic depth. As the sniper, you must carefully plan your moves, utilize cover, and think several steps ahead to outwit the soldiers. For the soldier players, cooperation and deduction are key. You'll need to communicate effectively, share information, and anticipate the sniper's tactics to corner them successfully.

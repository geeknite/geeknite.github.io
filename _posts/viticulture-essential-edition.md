## Gameplay Mechanics

### Setting Up the Vineyard

Each player starts with a small vineyard, a few workers, and a dream. The goal is simple: produce high-quality wines and earn the most victory points. Players take turns placing workers to perform various tasks such as planting vines, harvesting grapes, and aging wine in cellars. Every decision matters, and timing is crucial.

**Pro Tip:** Always keep an eye on your opponents’ vineyards. Like a good wine, strategy in Viticulture only gets better with age.

### Seasons and Actions

Viticulture is played over several seasons, each offering different actions. In the spring, players choose their wake-up position to determine turn order and benefits. Summer allows planting and building, while fall is time for attracting visitors with unique abilities. Winter is all about harvesting and producing wine.

### Visitors and Events

Visitors bring special events and actions that can greatly impact your strategy. They provide bonuses or allow you to perform actions more efficiently. Use them wisely to maximize your vineyard’s potential.

**Funny Moment:** During one game, a player forgot to harvest before winter and ended up with frozen grapes. The table erupted in laughter as they desperately tried to salvage their wine production.

## Strategy Tips

### Worker Placement

Worker placement is at the heart of Viticulture. Balancing the number of workers you have with the tasks you need to complete is crucial. Invest early in gaining more workers to have a versatile and efficient vineyard.

### Wine Production

Focus on producing high-quality wines. Plant the right vines, manage your grape harvests, and use cellars effectively. Quality over quantity can often be the key to winning.

### Seasonal Planning

Plan your seasons carefully. Prioritize actions that set you up for success in subsequent turns. Remember, good things come to those who wait—especially in the wine business.

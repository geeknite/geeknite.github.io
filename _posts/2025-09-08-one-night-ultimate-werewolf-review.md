## Introduction

Welcome, fellow gamers, to the wild and wacky world of **One Night Ultimate Werewolf**! If you're a fan of fast-paced party games and love a bit of deception, then this game is bound to be your next obsession. Get ready to accuse your friends, lie through your teeth, and howl at the moon in laughter!

## What is One Night Ultimate Werewolf?

One Night Ultimate Werewolf is a quick, 10-minute party game where players take on various roles within a village plagued by werewolves. The goal is simple: figure out who the werewolves are and vote to eliminate them before they devour the villagers. But beware, everyone has a secret role, and deception is key.

### The Basics

In One Night Ultimate Werewolf, players receive a secret role card. Roles include werewolves, villagers, and special characters like the Seer, Robber, and Troublemaker. Each role has unique abilities that can be used during the night phase to gather information or cause chaos.

### Components

The game includes:
- **Role Cards**: Beautifully illustrated cards representing different characters.
- **Tokens**: Used to track roles and votes.
- **App**: A helpful app to guide players through the night phase.

**Pro Tip**: Don't let your cat near the tokens. Those claws are the real supervillains.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up One Night Ultimate Werewolf is a breeze. Simply shuffle the role cards, distribute them to players face down, and place any remaining cards in the center. Now you're ready to begin your quest to uncover the werewolves.

### Night Phase

Each player closes their eyes as the app guides them through the night phase. Players wake up one by one to perform their actions, such as looking at another player's card or swapping cards. Once everyone has had their turn, the night ends and the chaos begins.

### Day Phase

During the day phase, players open their eyes and discuss what happened during the night. Accusations fly, alliances form, and everyone tries to convince others of their innocence (or guilt). After a few minutes of discussion, players vote on who they believe is a werewolf.

### Winning the Game

If the werewolves are successfully eliminated, the villagers win. If the werewolves survive, they win. The game is quick, intense, and often hilarious.

## The Hilarity Factor

One of the best aspects of One Night Ultimate Werewolf is the humor built into the gameplay. From outrageous accusations to ridiculous lies, there's never a dull moment. The game embraces the absurdity of the situation, and you'll find yourself laughing as much as strategizing.

**Funny Moment**: During one game, our Troublemaker swapped cards without realizing they were actually a werewolf. The resulting confusion and laughter echoed for hours.

### Replayability

With multiple roles and endless combinations, One Night Ultimate Werewolf offers high replayability. No two games are ever the same, ensuring that players will return to this game time and time again for new challenges and laughs.

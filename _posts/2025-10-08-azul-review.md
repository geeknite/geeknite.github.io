## Introduction

Welcome, fellow board game enthusiasts! Today, we’re diving into the vibrant and colorful world of **Azul**, the masterpiece by Plan B Games from 2018. If you’ve ever wanted to feel like a Portuguese tile-laying artisan, now’s your chance. Prepare yourself for a journey filled with strategic placement, beautiful tiles, and maybe a few moments of regret when you realize you've completely blocked your own move.


## What is Azul?

Azul is a tile-laying board game designed by Michael Kiesling, where players take turns drafting tiles from suppliers to their player board. The objective is to score the most points by completing patterns and sets. But beware – misplacing a tile can lead to disastrous negative points, which might make you wish you had picked a different hobby.


### Components

The game comes with:

- **Tiles**: Gorgeous resin tiles that look good enough to eat (but please don't).
- **Player Boards**: Each player gets a board for arranging their tiles and tracking their progress.
- **Score Markers**: Points are tracked using adorable little markers. You’ll either love them or wish you could fling them across the room.
- **Bag**: A bag to draw tiles from randomly. It’s like a lucky dip, but with more strategy and less candy.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setup is fairly simple, making Azul a great pick for those who don’t want to spend an hour arranging pieces before they can start. Lay out the factory displays, fill them with tiles, and give each player their board. Now you’re ready to become a tile-laying maestro.

### Turns and Actions

On each turn, players take turns drafting tiles from the factory displays or the center of the table. You must place tiles intelligently to complete rows and columns on your player board. The tiles you don’t place correctly end up on the floor line, leading to negative points. Just like real life – mess up, and you’ll pay the price.

### Scoring

Scoring is based on completed rows, columns, and sets of colors. The more you complete, the more points you earn. But beware, scoring is also where the real strategic depth comes in. You need to plan ahead, anticipate your opponents’ moves, and avoid scenarios where you end up drafting tiles you don’t need. Remember, negative points are not your friends.

## The Strategy

### Basic Strategy

Azul is a game that rewards careful planning and strategic foresight. You need to think several moves ahead and keep an eye on what your opponents are doing. Drafting tiles you don’t need just to block others is a perfectly valid strategy – and a hilariously spiteful one as well.

### Advanced Tips

- **Tile Blocking**: Don’t be afraid to draft tiles that might hinder your opponents. It’s not just about what tiles you need, but also what tiles they need.
- **Floor Line Management**: Sometimes, you’ll have to take tiles you can’t use. Manage your floor line wisely to minimize negative points.
- **Pattern Completion**: Prioritize completing rows and columns for maximum points. The sooner you complete them, the more points you’ll rack up.

## The Experience

### Fun Factor

Azul is a game that balances strategy with fun. The beautiful components and straightforward rules make it accessible to new players, while the strategic depth keeps experienced gamers engaged. And let’s face it – there’s something deeply satisfying about completing a row of tiles.

### Humor and Mishaps

One of the funniest aspects of playing Azul is the sheer number of times you’ll accidentally mess up your own plans. Maybe you drafted tiles in the wrong order, or maybe you didn’t anticipate your opponent’s move. Either way, expect to laugh, groan, and maybe even facepalm a few times.

**Funny Moment**: During one game, a player managed to draft all the tiles they needed for a perfect row – only to realize they had nowhere to place them. The table erupted in laughter as we watched them scramble to minimize their negative points.

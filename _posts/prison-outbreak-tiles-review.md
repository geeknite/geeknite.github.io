Prepare for a hilarious and thrilling journey through the corridors, cells, and yards of a zombie-infested prison!

## What is Prison Outbreak?

**Prison Outbreak** is a standalone expansion for the popular board game **Zombicide**. It thrusts players into the heart of a maximum-security prison overrun by zombies. With new characters, missions, and game tiles, this expansion offers a fresh and exciting experience for both veteran players and newcomers.

### Components

The game tiles are the heart of **Prison Outbreak**. They are beautifully crafted and designed to create an immersive environment. Each tile represents different prison locations, such as cell blocks, shower rooms, and the ever-dreaded solitary confinement.

**Fun Fact**: The tiles are so detailed that you might start wondering if the designers had a side gig as prison architects.

## Exploring the Tiles

### The Cell Block

The cell block tiles are where the magic happens. These tiles are filled with narrow corridors, locked doors, and zombie-infested cells. Navigating through these tiles requires strategic planning and a bit of luck. Be prepared for intense firefights and nail-biting escapes.

### The Yard

The yard tiles offer a different kind of challenge. With open spaces and fewer obstacles, it might seem like a walk in the park. But don't let your guard down! Zombies can swarm you from all directions, turning the yard into a death trap.

### The Shower Room

Ah, the shower room. A place of vulnerability and danger. These tiles are filled with cramped spaces and slippery floors. Perfect for ambushes and surprise attacks. Make sure your characters are armed and ready to fight their way out.

## Gameplay Mechanics

**Prison Outbreak** introduces new mechanics that make the game even more thrilling. The special tiles add layers of strategy and unpredictability.

## What is Zombicide: Special Guest Edouard Guiton?

**Zombicide: Special Guest Edouard Guiton** is an expansion pack for the popular Zombicide board game series. Designed by Edouard Guiton, this set includes unique hero characters, epic miniatures, and special scenario cards that bring a new level of excitement to your zombie-slaying adventures.

### Components

The expansion features beautifully sculpted miniatures, including new hero characters like **Shannon the Chainsaw Warrior** and **Carlos the Exterminator**. Each character comes with their own unique abilities and weapons, adding variety and strategy to your Zombicide gameplay. The artwork and design are top-notch, showcasing Guiton's signature style.

**Fun Fact**: One of the hero characters, **Shannon**, is armed with a chainsaw that is so detailed, you'll almost hear the roar when she slices through zombies!

## Gameplay

### Heroes and Abilities

Each hero in the Edouard Guiton expansion has unique abilities that can turn the tide of battle. For example, **Carlos** can throw grenades, making him perfect for clearing out hordes of zombies. **Shannon** excels in close combat with her chainsaw, making her a formidable force against the undead.

### Turn Phases

Just like the core Zombicide game, each turn consists of several phases:

1. **Player Phase**: Players perform actions like moving, attacking, and using special abilities.
2. **Zombie Phase**: Zombies move and attack. Prepare for chaos!
3. **End Phase**: Resolve any special effects or objectives.

### Scenario Cards

The expansion includes new scenario cards that introduce fresh challenges and objectives. Whether you're rescuing survivors or searching for critical supplies, these scenarios add depth and replayability to your Zombicide experience.

### What is Battle of Sedan?

The game also includes detailed rule books, scenario cards, and player aids to help you navigate the complexities of 19th-century warfare.

**Pro Tip**: Make sure you have ample table space. This battlefield is no small skirmish!

## Gameplay

### Setting Up

Setting up Battle of Sedan is like preparing for a grand military campaign. Lay out the board, position your units according to the scenario setup, and keep your rulebook handy (you’ll need it). Each player gets a deck of command cards that dictate their actions and strategies.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn is divided into several phases: Command, Movement, Combat, and Morale. Players use their command cards to issue orders to their units, move them across the battlefield, engage in combat, and manage their army's morale. The strategic depth of this game is immense, with every decision potentially altering the course of the battle.

### Combat

Combat in Battle of Sedan involves rolling dice and comparing results against unit statistics. Terrain, unit type, and morale all play significant roles in determining the outcome. Did you line up your artillery just right to decimate the enemy's cavalry? Or did you miscalculate and leave your infantry exposed? Welcome to the chaos of 19th-century warfare.

## Historical Accuracy

One of the standout features of Battle of Sedan is its commitment to historical accuracy. The scenarios are based on actual events from the Franco-Prussian War, and the game mechanics reflect the tactics and technologies of the time. This is as close as you can get to commanding forces in the 1870s without needing a time machine.

### Scenarios

The game includes multiple scenarios, each with its own unique setup and victory conditions. From the initial engagements to the climactic battles, each scenario offers a different challenge and requires a different approach. You can even create custom scenarios for endless replayability.

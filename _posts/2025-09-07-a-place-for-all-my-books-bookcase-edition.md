## **Why You Need a Good Bookcase**

1. **The Assembly Saga:** IKEA bookcases are notorious for their assembly challenges. Expect to spend a good chunk of your weekend battling Allen wrenches and cryptic instructions. Just remember, the finished product is worth the pain.

2. **Bookcase Overload:** Don't overload your bookcase. A collapsing bookcase is not only dangerous but also a sign that you might need to scale back on your shopping sprees.

## What's in the Box?

Upon opening the Slate Basing Kit, you'll find:
- Various sizes of slate pieces
- PVA glue
- Sand and gravel mix
- Static grass
- A mysterious substance that looks suspiciously like unicorn dust (okay, it's just fine flock)

## First Impressions

My first thought when I opened this kit was, "Wow, that's a lot of slate!" Seriously, if you need slate for your bases, this kit has got you covered. The variety of sizes is impressive, ranging from tiny chips to larger chunks that could double as terrain pieces in a pinch.

### Pros

- **Variety of slate sizes:** You won't be running out of options anytime soon.
- **Quality materials:** The slate and other basing materials are top-notch.
- **Easy to use:** Even if you're all thumbs, this kit makes basing straightforward.

### Cons

- **The glue could be better:** The PVA glue included is decent, but I've used better. It dries relatively quickly, but isn't as strong as some other brands.
- **No instructions:** If you're new to basing, you'll have to rely on your instincts or YouTube tutorials.

## Putting It to the Test

I decided to base a few of my miniatures using the Slate Basing Kit. Here's a step-by-step guide of the process:

### Step 1: Prepare Your Miniatures

Make sure your miniatures are clean and ready for basing. If they're already painted, be extra careful not to mess up your beautiful paint job.

### Step 2: Apply PVA Glue

Using a brush or a toothpick, apply a layer of PVA glue to the base of your miniature. Try not to get it on yourself. Trust me.

### Step 3: Add Slate Pieces

Carefully place the slate pieces onto the glue. Mix and match the sizes to create a natural look. Or just throw them on haphazardly and call it "art." Your choice.

### Step 4: Add Sand and Gravel Mix

Sprinkle the sand and gravel mix over the glue, filling in the gaps between the slate pieces. This is where you'll start to see your base take shape.

### Step 5: Apply Static Grass

Once the glue has dried, apply a thin layer of glue to the areas where you want grass. Sprinkle the static grass over these areas. Pro tip: gently blowing on the grass will make it stand upright, giving it a more natural look.

### Step 6: Unicorn Dust (Fine Flock)

Finally, add some fine flock to give your base that extra bit of detail. This stuff is like the cherry on top of your basing sundae.

## Final Thoughts

Overall, I'm impressed with the Slate Basing Kit. It's a great addition to any hobbyist's toolkit and makes basing your miniatures easy and fun. The variety of materials included ensures that you'll have plenty of options for creating unique bases.

### Final Recommendation

Would I recommend the Slate Basing Kit? Absolutely! Whether you're a seasoned pro or a beginner, this kit has something for everyone. Just be prepared to upgrade the glue if you're looking for something a bit stronger.

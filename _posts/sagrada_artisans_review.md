**Spoiler Alert:** If you think dice games are all about luck, Sagrada: Artisans might just change your mind. Or make you throw dice at your friends. Either way, it’s entertaining.

## Overview

Sagrada: Artisans is a legacy-style game where players take on the role of master artisans, competing to create the most intricate and beautiful stained glass windows. Unlike the original Sagrada game, which was a one-time experience, Artisans adds a campaign mode where your decisions carry over from one game to the next. Think of it as Project Runway, but with dice and less drama.

### Game Components

Inside the box, you'll find a plethora of colorful dice, transparent window panels, and a booklet that looks like it belongs in an art class. The artwork is stunning, and the quality of the components is top-notch—perfect for showing off to your friends who still think Monopoly is the pinnacle of board gaming.

**Pro Tip:** Keep track of those tiny dice. They have a tendency to roll under the table, sort of like your hopes of finishing the game without someone rage-quitting.

## How to Play

The gameplay mechanics are similar to the original Sagrada, with a few added twists. Players draft dice and place them on their window panels, adhering to placement rules based on color and number. The legacy aspect introduces new objectives, powers, and challenges as you progress through the campaign.

### Legacy System

Sagrada: Artisans employs a legacy system where your choices have lasting effects. Did you mess up that beautiful red pane in Game 1? Too bad—your future games will remind you of your failure. The campaign booklet guides players through a series of games, each adding new elements that keep the gameplay fresh and engaging.

**Criticism Alert:** The legacy system is fun, but can be punishing for new players who make early mistakes. It's like trying to fix a botched haircut—you'll laugh about it later, but it’s painful in the moment.

## Gameplay Experience

For those days when your board game buddies are busy, Sagrada: Artisans offers a solo mode. It’s a decent challenge that lets you hone your artisan skills without the pressure of social interaction. Perfect for introverts or anyone avoiding their annoying cousin.

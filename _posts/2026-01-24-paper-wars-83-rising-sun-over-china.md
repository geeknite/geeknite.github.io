## The Basics of Rising Sun Over China

"Rising Sun Over China" is a wargame that pits players against each other in a strategic battle for dominance. Set in the backdrop of historical conflicts, this game requires careful planning, tactical maneuvers, and a bit of luck to emerge victorious.

### Components

The game comes with a beautifully designed board depicting various historical locations, detailed unit counters, and a plethora of cards that add depth and variability to each playthrough. The artwork is top-notch, immersing players in the historical setting and enhancing the overall experience.

**Fun Fact**: The game includes a special "General's Hat" token that you can wear while strategizing. It's not mandatory, but it sure makes you look more authoritative.

## Gameplay

### Turn Phases

Each turn in "Rising Sun Over China" consists of several phases:

1. **Planning Phase**: Players secretly plan their moves and allocate resources.
2. **Action Phase**: Execute your plans by moving units, engaging in battles, and utilizing special abilities.
3. **Event Phase**: Draw event cards that introduce new challenges or opportunities. (Because why not add a little chaos?)
4. **Resolution Phase**: Resolve conflicts and update the board state based on the outcomes of battles and events.

### Winning and Losing

To win, players must achieve their strategic objectives before their opponents. This often involves capturing key territories, controlling resources, and outsmarting rival generals. If you fail to meet your objectives or lose all your units, it's game over. Better luck next time, commander.

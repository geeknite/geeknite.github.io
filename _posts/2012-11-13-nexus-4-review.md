# Nexus 4 Review: A Blast from the Past

**Hello Geeknite readers!** Today, we're taking a trip down memory lane with the Nexus 4. Yes, you read that right-the Nexus 4. It's 2025, and this classic smartphone from Google and LG is still kicking around. So, is it worth considering in today's tech landscape, or should it be left in the relic bin? Grab your popcorn and let's find out!

## **Design and Build Quality**

If nostalgia had a physical form, it would be the Nexus 4. Released back in 2012, this phone was a beauty with its glass back and sleek design. Fast forward to 2025, and it still holds up surprisingly well. Available in black and white, the Nexus 4's build quality could probably survive a few accidental drops (not that we're recommending you try it).

## **Display**

The Nexus 4 features a 4.7-inch IPS display with a resolution of 1280x768 pixels. While it pales in comparison to today's 4K screens, it was quite the stunner back in the day. The colors are decent, and the viewing angles are acceptable, although don't expect to be blown away if you're used to modern AMOLED displays.

## **Performance**

Under the hood, the Nexus 4 is powered by the Snapdragon S4 Pro processor, coupled with 2GB of RAM. Back in 2012, this was top-of-the-line tech. But in 2025, it's like trying to run Windows 98 on a MacBook Pro-painful yet nostalgic. Basic tasks like browsing and texting are still manageable, but don't expect to run the latest apps effortlessly.

## **Camera**

The Nexus 4 sports an 8MP rear camera and a 1.3MP front camera. It's no DSLR, but it takes decent photos for its age. The images are grainy and lack detail compared to modern smartphones, but hey, it's a piece of history. Selfies are handled by the front camera, though you'll look more like a pixelated version of yourself.

## **Battery Life**

One of the biggest challenges with older smartphones is battery life, and the Nexus 4 is no exception. The 2100mAh battery struggles to keep up with today's power-hungry apps and usage patterns. Expect to carry a portable charger if you plan to use this phone for more than a few hours.

## **Software**

The Nexus 4 originally ran Android 4.2 Jelly Bean, but you can now find custom ROMs that bring it up to Android 10. While it adds some modern features, the hardware limitations mean that the experience isn't exactly smooth sailing. If you're adventurous, you can give it a shot, but don't say we didn't warn you.

## **Price and Availability**

In 2025, the Nexus 4 can be found in the depths of eBay and other second-hand markets. Prices vary, but you can snag one for around $50. It's a bargain for a slice of tech history, but don't expect it to be your daily driver.

## **Conclusion**

The Nexus 4 is a nostalgic piece of tech that's fun to revisit but impractical for modern use. It has a premium design, decent display, and acceptable performance for its time. However, the outdated camera, battery, and software make it more of a collector's item than a daily smartphone.

In this blog post, I will review the iGPSPORT BSC300 and tell you why I think it is a great option for cyclists who want to improve their performance and enjoy their rides. I will also compare it to some of the other popular bike computers on the market, such as the iGPSPORT 630, the Garmin Edge 530, and the Garmin Edge 540. If you're considering a premium upgrade, you might also want to read about the [Garmin Edge 1040's advanced features]({%- post_url 2023-09-11-garmin-edge-1040-review -%}). By the end of this post, you will have a better idea of which bike computer suits your needs and budget.

## What is the iGPSPORT BSC300?

The iGPSPORT BSC300 is a wireless bike computer that can connect to various sensors via Bluetooth or ANT+. It can measure your speed, cadence, heart rate, power, altitude, temperature, and more. It has a 2.2-inch color screen that is easy to read in any light condition. It has a built-in GPS that can track your route and distance. It has a long battery life of up to 22 hours. It has a waterproof rating of IPX7, which means it can withstand rain and splashes.

The iGPSPORT BSC300 can also sync with your smartphone via the iGPSPORT app. You can customize your data fields, upload your rides to online platforms like Strava and Garmin Connect, and receive notifications for calls, messages, and social media. **You can also download maps and routes from the app and follow them on the device.**

The iGPSPORT BSC300 comes with a mount that can be attached to your handlebar or stem. It also comes with a speed sensor and a cadence sensor that can be easily installed on your bike. You can pair it with other sensors that support Bluetooth or ANT+, such as heart rate monitors, power meters, or smart trainers. For cyclists interested in tracking comprehensive training data, understanding how different sensors work together is crucial - our [Strava vs Garmin Connect comparison]({%- post_url 2013-09-30-strava-vs-garmin-connect-review-of-best-track-analyzers -%}) explains how to make the most of your data across platforms.

The [iGPSPORT BSC300 costs around $150]({{ site.constants.wsib }}igpsport bsc300), which is much cheaper than some of the other bike computers with similar features. It is also available in black or white colors.

## Real-World Experience: A Year of Testing

After using the BSC300 for over a year, I can share some honest insights about its daily performance. Overall, I've been quite satisfied with this device, and it does everything you'd expect from a bike computer in this price range. However, there are some limitations worth noting.

**The Good:**
- Reliable GPS tracking and data accuracy
- Excellent battery life for long rides
- Simple setup and sensor pairing process
- Good value for money compared to premium alternatives

**Areas for Improvement:**
One noticeable limitation is the lack of a status bar, which makes it frustrating to check the current time during long rides. This might seem minor, but when you're on a century ride or multi-hour adventure, having quick access to the time becomes more important than you'd think.

**Navigation Considerations:**
The navigation features work well for most scenarios, but I've experienced issues with out-and-back routes on the same road. The device can get confused and sometimes turns off the green marked road display, making it appear as though you're off course when you're actually following the correct path. This seems to be a software limitation that affects various iGPSPORT models. For routes without overlapping sections, the navigation works perfectly fine.

**GPS Accuracy Tips:**
For optimal performance, especially in mountainous areas, make sure to keep the GPS settings at their most accurate configuration. I've noticed that changing the GPS precision settings can lead to inaccurate slope data and unreliable climb features during mountain rides. This is particularly important if you're considering upgrading to more advanced units like the [Garmin Edge 540 with its ClimbPro feature]({%- post_url 2023-07-06-garmin-edge-540-review -%}), where accurate elevation data becomes crucial for climb analysis.

**Setup and Initial Use:**
When first setting up the device, be patient with the initial GPS lock - it can take several minutes to acquire satellite signal, especially if you're indoors. Make sure to be outside for the first few uses to establish a good GPS connection. 

For navigation features, you'll need to download maps from the iGPSPORT website and transfer them to the device. If you encounter issues with map loading, try deleting the specific map file and copying it again to the device folder - this usually resolves any transfer problems.

**Button Design Considerations:**
One design aspect that might take some getting used to is the button placement on the sides of the device. While this follows the same approach as Garmin's 500 series, some users might find it less intuitive than having buttons on the top surface, especially when riding at higher speeds. However, you do adapt to this layout fairly quickly with regular use.

## How does the iGPSPORT BSC300 compare to other bike computers?

There are many bike computers on the market, but I will focus on three of the most popular ones: the iGPSPORT 630, the Garmin Edge 530, and the Garmin Edge 540. These are all wireless bike computers that can measure similar data and connect to various sensors. They also have color screens, GPS, long battery life, waterproof rating, smartphone sync, and navigation features. However, they also have some differences that might make you prefer one over another.

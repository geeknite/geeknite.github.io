## Specifications

The iGPSPORT BSC300 is like the Swiss Army knife of bike sensors. This bad boy measures:

- Speed
- Cadence
- Heart rate
- Power
- Altitude
- Temperature
- And more!

But wait, there's more! It has a built-in GPS, a 2.2-inch color screen that's easier to read than your grandma's large-print bingo cards, and a battery life that lasts up to 22 hours. It's also waterproof with an IPX7 rating, meaning it can survive your melodramatic tears when you miss a turn.

## Connectivity

### Smartphone Sync

This device isn't just smart; it's a genius. The iGPSPORT BSC300 can sync with your smartphone via the iGPSPORT app. Customize your data fields, upload your rides to online platforms like Strava and Garmin Connect, and even receive notifications for calls, messages, and social media. You can also download maps and routes and follow them on the device. Yeah, it's like having Google Mapsâ€”but cooler.

### External Sensors

The iGPSPORT BSC300 comes with a mount you can attach to your handlebar or stem, a speed sensor, and a cadence sensor. If you want to get fancy, you can pair it with other sensors that support Bluetooth or ANT+, including heart rate monitors and power meters. It's like assembling the Avengers, but for your bike.

## Comparison to Other Bike Computers

There are many bike computers on the market, but I will focus on three of the most popular ones: the iGPSPORT 630, the Garmin Edge 530, and the Garmin Edge 540. These are all wireless bike computers that can measure similar data and connect to various sensors. They also have color screens, GPS, long battery life, waterproof rating, smartphone sync, and navigation features. However, they also have some differences that might make you prefer one over another.

### The iGPSPORT 630

The iGPSPORT 630 is another wireless bike computer from iGPSPORT that costs around $199.99 [check for offers at Foxxs]({{ site.constants.wsib }}/igpsport igs630). It's the big brother of the BCS300, it has a larger screen than the BSC300 (3 inches) and more data fields (up to 15). **It also has more navigation features, such as turn-by-turn directions, voice prompts, and offline maps**. It has a slightly shorter battery life than the BSC300 (20 hours) and a lower waterproof rating (IPX6).

The iGPSPORT 630 is a good choice for cyclists who want a bigger screen and more navigation options. However, it is also more expensive and less durable than the BSC300.

### The Garmin Edge 530

The Garmin Edge 530 is a wireless bike computer from Garmin that costs around $299.99 [check for offers at Foxxs]({{ site.constants.wsib }}/garmin edge 530). It has a similar screen size as the BSC300 (2.6 inches) but more data fields (up to 20). It also has more advanced navigation features, such as turn-by-turn directions, route planning, and trendline popularity routing. The battery life is slightly shorter at 20 hours, and it has a waterproof rating of IPX7.

### The Garmin Edge 540

The Garmin Edge 540 is an upgraded version of the Edge 530, costing around $349.99 [check for offers at Foxxs]({{ site.constants.wsib }}/garmin edge 540). It has the same screen size as the Edge 530 but even more data fields (up to 25). It also includes additional navigation features like live tracking, incident detection, and bike alarm. The battery life is similar at 20 hours, and it maintains the IPX7 waterproof rating.

## Final Recommendation

In a world where every cyclist's dream is to pedal into the horizon with seamless data and connectivity, the iGPSPORT BSC300 stands out. With its plethora of features at an affordable price, it caters to both the weekend warriors and the serious cyclists.

**How does the iGPSPORT BSC300 compare to other bike computers?**

There are many bike computers on the market, but I will focus on three of the most popular ones: the iGPSPORT 630, the Garmin Edge 530, and the Garmin Edge 540. These are all wireless bike computers that can measure similar data and connect to various sensors. They also have color screens, GPS, long battery life, waterproof rating, smartphone sync, and navigation features. However, they also have some differences that might make you prefer one over another.

*The iGPSPORT 630*

The iGPSPORT 630 is another wireless bike computer from iGPSPORT that costs around $199.99 [check for offers at Foxxs]({{ site.constants[0].wsib }}/igpsport igs630). It's the big brother of the BCS300, it has a larger screen than the BSC300 (3 inches) and more data fields (up to 15). **It also has more navigation features, such as turn-by-turn directions, voice prompts, and offline maps**. It has a slightly shorter battery life than the BSC300 (20 hours) and a lower waterproof rating (IPX6).

The iGPSPORT 630 is a good choice for cyclists who want a bigger screen and more navigation options. However, it is also more expensive and less durable than the BSC300.

It has a longer battery life than the BSC300 (up to 40 hours) and a higher waterproof rating (IPX7).

The Garmin Edge 530 is a great choice for cyclists who want the most comprehensive and sophisticated bike computer. However, it is also much more expensive and complex than the BSC300.

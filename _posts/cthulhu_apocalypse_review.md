## The Basics

### What is Cthulhu Apocalypse?

Cthulhu Apocalypse is a cooperative board game set in a Lovecraftian universe. Players take on the roles of investigators trying to thwart the rise of Cthulhu and other eldritch horrors. It’s like a group therapy session, but instead of sharing feelings, you’re sharing the burden of impending doom.

### Components

The game includes:

- **Miniatures**: Detailed miniatures of investigators and eldritch creatures that are both stunning and terrifying.
- **Cards**: Event cards, item cards, and action cards – all beautifully illustrated.
- **Game Board**: Various locations including haunted mansions, creepy forests, and abandoned towns.
- **Tokens and Markers**: Used to track sanity, health, and other game effects.

**Pro Tip**: Don’t let the Tentacle Monster near the miniatures. Your dog might think it’s a new chew toy.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up Cthulhu Apocalypse requires a lot of space and maybe a few sacrifices (of snacks, not people). Lay out the game board, shuffle the cards, distribute miniatures, and place tokens. Now, you’re ready to face the eldritch horrors.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players draw cards and perform actions based on their investigator’s abilities. You can move, investigate locations, fight monsters, and try to maintain your sanity. Cooperation and strategy are crucial to survival.

### Combat

Combat in Cthulhu Apocalypse is a mix of strategy and luck. Each investigator has unique abilities and weapons to battle eldritch creatures. Did you plan an epic attack just to have your sanity shattered by an eldritch whisper? Welcome to the madness!

## The Madness Awesomeness

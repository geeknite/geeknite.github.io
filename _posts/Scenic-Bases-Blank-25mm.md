## What Are Scenic Bases?

Imagine your miniature models looking like they've crash-landed on a distant planet or are standing triumphantly on a mossy rock. Scenic bases are designed to give your miniatures a little extra 'oomph' – yes, that's a technical term. These 25mm blanks are versatile, allowing you to create a masterpiece without fighting with a teeny-tiny canvas.

## Key Features

### Versatility

These blank bases are like the tofu of the miniature world – they take on any flavor you add. Want to recreate the Battle of Helm's Deep? Go ahead. How about a diorama of a goblin tea party? The only limit is your imagination.

### Durability

Made from high-quality plastic, these bases can withstand the rough-and-tumble of tabletop gaming, accidental drops, and even your dog's curiosity (though we don't recommend testing this). They're sturdy enough to support even the heftiest minis. Yes, we're looking at you, Warhammer 40K players.

### Ease of Use

With a smooth surface, these bases are ready for action. They’re perfect for various basing materials – sand, gravel, grass, and anything that won’t scream “I’m from your neighbor’s backyard.” Just slap on some glue, sprinkle your materials, and voila! Instant masterpiece.

## Painting Tips and Tricks

### Prime Time

Always start with a primer. It’s like the foundation of a house – or the first layer of nachos. Keep your paint job smooth and avoid the dreaded ‘chip’.

### Color Theory

Don’t just slap paint on it indiscriminately (unless you’re into abstract art). Think about the environment your mini is in – arid desert, lush forest, post-apocalyptic wasteland. Choose colors that complement the theme.

### Details, Details, Details

Dry brushing and washes can bring out the intricate details of your base. Remember, it’s all in the little things. Flock it, add tufts of grass, use tiny rocks – make it pop!

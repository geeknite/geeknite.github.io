## Introduction

Welcome, chummers, to the definitive review of **Shadowrun 5th Edition: Run & Gun**! If you're a fan of tactical combat, explosive action, and enough firepower to make Rambo blush, then this supplement is your ticket to the big leagues of the Shadowrun universe.

## What is Run & Gun?

### The Basics

Run & Gun is a supplement for the Shadowrun 5th Edition tabletop RPG that focuses on combat and tactics. It's like the ultimate ammo dump for your favorite street samurai, mercenary, or gun-toting maniac. With new weapons, armor, combat rules, and tactics, Run & Gun takes your Shadowrunning experience from zero to sixty faster than you can say "bullet storm."

### Key Features

1. **Weapons Galore**: From pistols to assault rifles, and even some exotic weapons, this book has it all. Ever wanted to wield a laser gun or a chainsaw? Now you can.
2. **Armor & Gear**: New armor options, gear, and gadgets to keep your runner safe and stylish. Because let's face it, looking good while dodging bullets is half the battle.
3. **Combat Maneuvers**: Advanced combat maneuvers and tactics to outsmart, outgun, and outlast your enemies. Time to level up your strategic game.
4. **Explosives**: More grenades, bombs, and other fun explosive toys to make sure your enemies remember you. And by “remember,” we mean in pieces.

## In-Depth Look

Run & Gun introduces a staggering variety of new weapons. Whether you're into traditional firearms, melee weapons, or want to try out some new tech like laser guns or sonic disruptors, this supplement has you covered. The detailed descriptions, stats, and illustrations make it easy to visualize yourself wreaking havoc on the battlefield.

**Funny Moment**: In one session, our street samurai tried to use a chainsaw in a narrow alley fight. The chaos that ensued was legendary (and hilarious). Let's just say, chainsaws and cramped spaces don't mix well.

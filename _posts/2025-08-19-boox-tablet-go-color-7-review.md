Welcome back, Geeknite readers! Today, we're diving into the colorful world of e-readers with a detailed review of the **BOOX Tablet Go Color 7**. This Android-powered, color e-ink device promises to revolutionize your reading experience, but does it deliver? Based on real user experiences and thorough testing, let's explore what makes this device special—and where it might fall short.

## **Design and Build Quality: Compact Color Revolution**

The BOOX Tablet Go Color 7 brings color e-ink technology to a compact 7-inch form factor. As one Spanish user, José Antonio, perfectly described it: "Perfect characteristics if you're looking for something more special than a basic Kindle ebook." The device feels premium in hand, though some users note the sharp corners don't make it as comfortable to hold as traditional rounded e-readers.

### **Color Display Innovation**

The star of the show is undoubtedly the color e-ink display. While the colors aren't as vibrant as an LCD tablet (and they shouldn't be—this is e-ink after all), they add a new dimension to reading, especially for comics and illustrated books. One user specifically praised the comic mode, which allows you to crop pages and read panels full-screen—a thoughtful touch for comic enthusiasts.

## **Display: The Good, The Bad, and The Colorful**

The 7-inch color e-ink display is both the device's greatest strength and its biggest challenge. Let's be honest about what you're getting:

### **The Reality of Color E-Ink**

The colors are there, but they're subtle—think watercolors rather than oil paintings. For comics and illustrated books, this adds a pleasant dimension without being overwhelming. However, several users noted that the display tends to be quite dark, requiring you to keep the brightness at maximum most of the time.

### **Brightness and Eye Strain Concerns**

Here's where user experiences vary significantly. While some found the reading experience comfortable, others reported more eye strain compared to traditional e-readers. One German user specifically mentioned that "the display makes the eyes terribly tired" compared to Kindle Paperwhite and other devices. The dark mode still illuminates the entire screen when viewed from the side, which defeats the purpose of reading without disturbing a sleeping partner.

## **Performance and Battery Life: The Android Advantage (and Weakness)**

Here's where the BOOX Tablet Go Color 7 truly differentiates itself from basic e-readers. Running Android means you can install virtually any reading app—Kindle, Google Play Books, Dropbox, Google Drive, you name it. As José Antonio noted: "The ability to use Android apps is a hit."

### **The Performance Reality**

The device handles basic operations smoothly, though don't expect tablet-level responsiveness. Page turns are generally smooth, and the interface is functional. Oscar mentioned that "as a reader it's good and looks fine," though he also noted some small bugs and poor Spanish translations in the menus.

### **Battery Life**

Battery life is another mixed bag. While the e-ink display is much more power-efficient than an LCD, running Android apps can drain the battery faster than you'd expect from a traditional e-reader. One user reported that they "needed to recharge more frequently than expected," especially when using apps that require constant updates or connectivity.

## **Software Experience: The Good, The Bad, and The Buggy**

Running on Android, the BOOX Tablet Go Color 7 offers a versatile but sometimes buggy software experience. Here's what you need to know:

### **App Compatibility**

Having access to the Google Play Store is a game-changer for an e-reader. You can download and use any reading app you prefer, from Kindle to OverDrive. This flexibility is a massive plus for users who are tied into specific ecosystems.

### **Software Bugs and Updates**

However, with great flexibility comes great responsibility—or in this case, occasional headaches. Several users reported encountering bugs and glitches. "The software needs more polishing," one user remarked, noting occasional crashes and slowdowns. On the bright side, BOOX frequently releases updates that address these issues, so there's hope for continuous improvement.

## **Pros and Cons**

### **Pros**

- **Color e-ink display**: Adds a new dimension to reading, especially for comics and illustrated books.
- **Android OS**: Access to a wide range of reading apps through Google Play Store.
- **Compact design**: Easy to carry around and use on the go.
- **Comic mode**: Enhanced reading experience for comic enthusiasts.

### **Cons**

- **Display brightness**: Often needs to be kept at maximum, leading to faster battery drain.
- **Eye strain**: Some users reported more eye strain compared to traditional e-readers.
- **Software bugs**: Occasional glitches and crashes can be frustrating.
- **Battery life**: Not as long-lasting as traditional e-readers, especially with intensive app usage.

## **Final Verdict**

The BOOX Tablet Go Color 7 is a unique and innovative e-reader that brings color to the world of e-ink. While it has some quirks, like display brightness and occasional software bugs, its strengths in versatility and app compatibility make it a compelling choice for tech-savvy bookworms and comic lovers. If you can live with its imperfections, this colorful e-reader might just be the perfect addition to your gadget collection.

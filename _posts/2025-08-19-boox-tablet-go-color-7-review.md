Welcome back, Geeknite readers! Today, we're diving into the colorful world of e-readers with a detailed review of the **BOOX Tablet Go Color 7**. This Android-powered, color e-ink device promises to revolutionize your reading experience, but does it deliver? Based on real user experiences and thorough testing, let's explore what makes this device special—and where it might fall short.

---

## **Design and Build Quality: Compact Color Revolution**

The BOOX Tablet Go Color 7 brings color e-ink technology to a compact 7-inch form factor. As one Spanish user, José Antonio, perfectly described it: "Perfect characteristics if you're looking for something more special than a basic Kindle ebook." The device feels premium in hand, though some users note the sharp corners don't make it as comfortable to hold as traditional rounded e-readers.

### **Color Display Innovation**

The star of the show is undoubtedly the color e-ink display. While the colors aren't as vibrant as an LCD tablet (and they shouldn't be—this is e-ink after all), they add a new dimension to reading, especially for comics and illustrated books. One user specifically praised the comic mode, which allows you to crop pages and read panels full-screen—a thoughtful touch for comic enthusiasts.

## **Display: The Good, The Bad, and The Colorful**

The 7-inch color e-ink display is both the device's greatest strength and its biggest challenge. Let's be honest about what you're getting:

### **The Reality of Color E-Ink**

The colors are there, but they're subtle—think watercolors rather than oil paintings. For comics and illustrated books, this adds a pleasant dimension without being overwhelming. However, several users noted that the display tends to be quite dark, requiring you to keep the brightness at maximum most of the time.

### **Brightness and Eye Strain Concerns**

Here's where user experiences vary significantly. While some found the reading experience comfortable, others reported more eye strain compared to traditional e-readers. One German user specifically mentioned that "the display makes the eyes terribly tired" compared to Kindle Paperwhite and other devices. The dark mode still illuminates the entire screen when viewed from the side, which defeats the purpose of reading without disturbing a sleeping partner.

## **Performance and Battery Life: The Android Advantage (and Weakness)**

Here's where the BOOX Tablet Go Color 7 truly differentiates itself from basic e-readers. Running Android means you can install virtually any reading app—Kindle, Google Play Books, Dropbox, Google Drive, you name it. As José Antonio noted: "The ability to use Android apps is a hit."

### **The Performance Reality**

The device handles basic operations smoothly, though don't expect tablet-level responsiveness. Page turns are generally smooth, and the interface is functional. Oscar mentioned that "as a reader it's good and looks fine," though he also noted some small bugs and poor Spanish translations in the menus.

### **Battery Life**

Battery life is solid, especially considering the color display. You'll get several weeks of casual reading on a single charge, though heavy use of Android apps will drain the battery faster. Charging is done via USB-C, which, as every geek knows, is the only correct answer to the charging port question.

## **Connectivity and Features: The Swiss Army Knife of E-Readers**

The BOOX Tablet Go Color 7 offers a plethora of connectivity options. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and even optional 4G LTE ensure you're always connected. Installing apps is a breeze, and the device supports a wide range of file formats—PDF, EPUB, TXT, and more.

### **Customization Galore**

One of the standout features is the ability to customize the reading experience. Font styles, sizes, margins, and even color themes can be adjusted to fit your preferences. It's like having a personal librarian who actually listens to your picky demands.

### **Drawing and Note-Taking**

If you're a fan of doodling or need to take quick notes, the BOOX Tablet Go Color 7 has you covered. The included stylus lets you sketch and annotate documents with ease. The note-taking app is functional, though it's not going to replace your favorite dedicated note-taking device anytime soon.

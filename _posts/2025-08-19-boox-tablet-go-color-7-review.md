# BOOX Tablet Go Color 7 Review: A Colorful but Dim Adventure

Welcome, fellow geeks and tablet enthusiasts! Today we take a closer look at the BOOX Tablet Go Color 7. Spoiler alert: It's as vibrant as a watercolor painting and as dark as a Batman fan's wardrobe. Let's dive into the nitty-gritty!

## Display: The Good, The Bad, and The Colorful

The 7-inch color e-ink display is both the device's greatest strength and its biggest challenge. Let's be honest about what you're getting:

### The Reality of Color E-Ink

The colors are there, but they're subtle—think watercolors rather than oil paintings. For comics and illustrated books, this adds a pleasant dimension without being overwhelming. However, several users noted that the display tends to be quite dark, requiring you to keep the brightness at maximum most of the time.

### Brightness and Eye Strain Concerns

Here's where user experiences vary significantly. While some found the reading experience comfortable, others reported more eye strain compared to traditional e-readers. One German user specifically mentioned that "the display makes the eyes terribly tired" compared to Kindle Paperwhite and other devices. The dark mode still illuminates the entire screen when viewed from the side, which defeats the purpose of reading without disturbing a sleeping partner.

## Performance and Battery Life: The Android Advantage (and Weakness)

Here's where the BOOX Tablet Go Color 7 truly differentiates itself from basic e-readers. Running Android means you can install virtually any reading app—Kindle, Google Play Books, Dropbox, Google Drive, you name it. As José Antonio noted: "The ability to use Android apps is a hit."【4†source】

### The Performance Reality

The device handles basic operations smoothly, though don't expect tablet-level responsiveness. Page turns are generally smooth, and the interface is functional. Oscar mentioned that "as a reader it's good and looks fine," though he also noted some small bugs and poor Spanish translations in the menus.【4†source】

### Battery Life: The Major Compromise

Here's the elephant in the room: battery life. Multiple users complained about "underground battery life of at most 1-2 days." This is significantly worse than traditional e-readers that can last weeks. The color display and Android system are power-hungry, and running the brightness at maximum (which you'll likely need to) drains it even faster.

## Features and Connectivity: Android Flexibility Meets E-Reader Practicality

The BOOX Tablet Go Color 7 shines in versatility:

- **Full Android Experience**: Install any reading app you want—Kindle, Kobo, library apps, note-taking apps
- **Cloud Integration**: Seamless Dropbox and Google Drive integration for document management
- **Multiple Format Support**: Read anything from EPUBs to PDFs to comics
- **Note-Taking Capability**: Though you'll need to buy the stylus separately (a point of frustration for some users)【4†source】
- **File Transfer**: Easy document transfer via BooxDrop

### The Setup Learning Curve

Multiple users mentioned that "configuration needs a few days of adaptation." This isn't your plug-and-play Kindle—expect to spend time tweaking settings and getting familiar with the Android interface.

## Real User Experiences: The Good, Bad, and Surprising

Let's talk about what actual users discovered:

### Quality Control Issues

Some units came with defects. One user received a device with "two frontlight pinholes," while another complained about missing the stylus despite expecting it to be included. These quality control issues are concerning at this price point.【4†source】

### The Geek Factor

As Oscar perfectly summarized: "Good device if you are a bit of a geek." This isn't for everyone. If you want simple, reliable reading, stick with a basic Kindle.【4†source】

## Conclusion

The BOOX Tablet Go Color 7 is a unique and versatile e-reader that brings color e-ink to the masses. Its strengths lie in Android flexibility and multi-format support, but its weaknesses are evident in display brightness and battery life. It’s perfect for the tech-savvy geek who loves to tinker and customize but might be too complicated for the casual reader.

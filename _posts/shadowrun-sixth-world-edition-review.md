## The Basics

### What is Shadowrun Sixth World Edition?

Shadowrun is a cyberpunk fantasy RPG set in a future where magic and technology collide.

Sixth World Edition is the latest version of the game, offering streamlined rules and a fresh take on the beloved setting.

### Components

## Gameplay

### Setting Up

Setting up Shadowrun is like preparing for a heist. You'll need to create your character, choose your gear, and discuss your mission with the Game Master (GM). It's a process that requires some time and imagination, but it's well worth the effort.

### Character Creation

Creating a character in Shadowrun is a joy. You can be anything from a street samurai with a cyber arm to a decker who can hack into any system. The options are vast, and the customization is incredibly satisfying. Just remember, with great power comes great responsibility... and a lot of paperwork.

### Rules and Mechanics

Shadowrun Sixth World Edition offers streamlined rules that make the game more accessible without sacrificing depth. The core mechanic revolves around rolling a pool of six-sided dice, where higher rolls are better. The game also introduces Edge, a system that lets you influence the outcome of your rolls in dramatic ways.

Despite its dark and gritty setting, Shadowrun has plenty of room for humor. From snarky NPCs to ridiculous situations, there's always something to laugh about.

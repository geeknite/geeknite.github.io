Card Battle Game** is here to tickle your whiskers and give you a purrfectly delightful gaming experience. Let's dive into this fun-filled frenzy of fur and strategy.

## What is Kitty Cat Clash?

Kitty Cat Clash is a competitive card battle game designed for 2-4 players. Each player takes on the role of a cat commander, leading their army of adorable yet fierce felines into battle. The goal is to outwit and outlast your opponents using a mix of strategy, luck, and pure cattitude.

### The Basics

In Kitty Cat Clash, players draw cards from their deck to deploy cats, activate abilities, and launch attacks. It's a mix of strategic planning and chaotic fun, with each game playing out differently based on the cards drawn and the players' decisions.

### Components

The game comes with:

- **Cat Cards**: Each cat has unique abilities and stats. From the sneaky Ninja Cat to the mighty Warrior Cat, there's a feline for every strategy.
- **Action Cards**: These cards allow players to perform special actions, like summoning extra cats or launching surprise attacks.
- **Game Board**: The battlefield where all the action takes place. It's designed with colorful, whimsical artwork that brings the cat world to life.
- **Tokens and Markers**: Used to track health, actions, and various effects during the game.
- **Special Dice**: Because what's a battle without a bit of luck?

**Pro Tip**: Keep your real cats away from the game board. We don't want any unauthorized card swaps!

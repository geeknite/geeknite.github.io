## Introduction

Welcome, fellow board gamers and samurai enthusiasts! Today, we embark on an epic journey to the land of the rising sun with **Senjutsu: Battle for Japan - All In Deluxe Kickstarter Edition**. Get ready for a review filled with strategy, honor, and maybe a misplaced katana or two. If you're a fan of Japanese culture, samurai battles, or just love a good board game, you're in for a treat!

## What is Senjutsu?

Senjutsu: Battle for Japan is a strategic board game set in feudal Japan. Players take on the roles of samurai warriors, engaging in tactical battles and navigating through historical events. This deluxe edition, funded through Kickstarter, promises a plethora of components, expansions, and beautifully crafted miniatures that bring the Sengoku period to life.

### Components

The All In Deluxe Kickstarter Edition comes with:
- **Miniatures**: Stunningly detailed samurai warriors, each with unique abilities and poses. It's like having a mini army at your disposal.
- **Game Board**: A beautifully illustrated map of Japan, featuring various provinces and battlefields.
- **Cards**: Hundreds of cards representing actions, events, and upgrades. Prepare for your table to look like a samurai's desk.
- **Tokens and Markers**: Used to track progress, health, and other game elements. They may also serve as excellent cat toys (use with caution).

**Pro Tip**: Keep your cat away from the miniatures. Those claws are the real shoguns of destruction.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up Senjutsu is akin to preparing for a grand battle. Lay out the game board, distribute the miniatures, and shuffle the cards. You might need a few tea breaks, but once everything is in place, the real fun begins.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players draw cards and choose actions based on their samurai's abilities. You can move, attack, defend, and perform special maneuvers. Strategy and timing are crucial, so think carefully before making your move.

### Combat

Combat in Senjutsu is a blend of strategy and luck. Players use their cards to attack, counter, and perform special moves. The tension mounts as you anticipate your opponent's actions and try to outsmart them. Did you plan an epic strike only to miss? Welcome to the world of samurai, where even the best-laid plans can go awry.

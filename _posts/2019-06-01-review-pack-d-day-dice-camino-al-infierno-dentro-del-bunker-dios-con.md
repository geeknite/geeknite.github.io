## Gameplay Overview

### D-Day Dice

D-Day Dice is a cooperative game where players take on the roles of soldiers storming the beaches of Normandy. The objective is simple: survive, conquer bunkers, and avoid turning into Swiss cheese from enemy fire. The base game is known for its intense, strategic gameplay and historically accurate scenarios.

#### Components

The game comes with beautifully detailed dice, soldier miniatures, and a variety of scenario maps. Each roll of the dice can either lead you to victory or doom you to a re-roll (or five). The artwork and quality of the components are top-notch, making every game session a visually pleasing experience.

**Pro Tip:** Don't eat the dice. They're not candy, no matter how tasty they look.

## How to Use

### Preparation

Sleeving your cards might seem like a simple task, but preparation is key. Here's the best way to approach it:

1. **Clean Hands**: Wash your hands before starting. You don't want to transfer any grime onto your fresh sleeves.
2. **Workspace**: Clear a space on your table and lay out your cards. Avoid places where your cat can jump in and cause chaos.
3. **Sleeving**: Insert cards into the sleeves gently. Avoid bending or warping the cards as you do so.

### Application

Once your cards are sleeved, it’s time to enjoy the benefits:

1. **Shuffling**: Enjoy the smooth shuffle experience. It’s like slicing through butter with a lightsaber.
2. **Protection**: Your cards are now safe from spills, scratches, and the occasional death star attack.
3. **Storage**: Store sleeved cards in deck boxes or organizers to keep them in pristine condition.

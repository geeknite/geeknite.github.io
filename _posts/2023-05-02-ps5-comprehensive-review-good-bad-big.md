Welcome, fellow gamers and console enthusiasts! If you thought the PS5 saga ended with the Good, the Bad, and the Big, think again. In 2026, Sony dropped the much-anticipated **PS5 Slim** version, and it's time to find out if it lives up to the hype.

## The Good, The Bad, The Bulky, and The Slim

### The Good

1. **Performance**: The PS5 Slim keeps the same beastly custom AMD RDNA 2 GPU and Zen 2 CPU from its chunky sibling. Whether you're running AAA titles or indie gems, the Slim handles them just as smoothly. If anything, it makes your living room look tidier. 

2. **DualSense Controller**: The DualSense controller continues to shine. With its haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, it offers an immersive experience that will have your thumbs thanking you. Plus, the Slim version pairs beautifully with the controller's sleek design.

3. **Exclusive Titles**: Games like *Demon's Souls* and *Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart* highlight the PS5's capabilities. The Slim doesn't disappoint in bringing these titles to life—just make sure you haven't skimped on your TV.

### The Bad

1. **Size**: The PS5 Slim is smaller but don't expect it to fit comfortably in your coat pocket. It's still quite a presence in your entertainment setup, but now it's more of a well-dressed guest than an obnoxious housemate.

2. **Price**: The PS5 Slim is still pricey, though not as much as its predecessor. You're looking at a price tag that makes it one of the more expensive gaming consoles out there. But hey, quality comes at a price, and at least it won't require a second mortgage.

3. **Supply Issues**: The PS5 Slim is easier to find compared to the original, but it still takes some effort. Scalpers are still lurking in the shadows, ready to pounce on unsuspecting gamers. It's like trying to buy a ticket to a Taylor Swift concert, but with less screaming and more grumpy gamers.

### The Bulky

Even with the Slim version, the PS5 is no featherweight. If you're planning to buy one, make sure you have enough space. It's like bringing home a new pet—a very large, electronic pet. You might have to consider rearranging your furniture or, better yet, build a shrine.

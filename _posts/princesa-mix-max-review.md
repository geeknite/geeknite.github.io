## **The Premise**

Princesa Mix-Max is a whimsical and charming board game where players compete to create the most fabulous and extravagant outfits for their princesses. It’s like Project Runway meets Disney royalty, with a sprinkle of fairy dust.

The goal is to mix and match different pieces of clothing to create a stunning ensemble that will win the admiration of the kingdom. Think mismatched socks, extravagant hats, and gowns that could give Cinderella a run for her money.

## **Gameplay**

### **Setting Up the Game**

Setting up Princesa Mix-Max is as easy as pie (and just as delightful). Each player starts with a princess board and a collection of clothing cards. The cards are divided into tops, bottoms, shoes, and accessories.

1. **Shuffle the Clothing Cards**: Shuffle the clothing cards and deal a number of cards to each player.
2. **Dress Your Princess**: Players take turns selecting clothing cards to dress their princesses. The key is to mix and match creatively while keeping an eye on the fashion trends set by the royal court.
3. **Score Points**: Points are scored based on the creativity and flair of the outfits. Bonus points are awarded for matching clothing sets or achieving specific fashion goals.

### **Turn Structure**

Each turn, players draw a clothing card from the deck and either use it to dress their princess or trade it with another player. The game continues until all players have completed their outfits, and then the final scoring takes place.

### **Special Actions**

- **Royal Swap**: Players can swap clothing cards with another player for a strategic advantage.

### 8 Recommendations to Save Big (or Avoid Disaster)

1. **Start with Amazon UK**  
   [Amazon UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&linkCode=ur2&tag={{ site.constants.amazon_uk }}) offers a wide selection of products, often at better prices than local Amazons. But remember, free shipping to Europe is a thing of the past. Post-Brexit, shipping fees and customs can add up quickly.

2. **Compare Prices Across European Amazons**  
   Use a single Amazon account to shop across [Amazon DE](https://www.amazon.de/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1638&creative=19454&linkCode=ur2&tag={{ site.constants.amazon_de }}), [Amazon IT](https://www.amazon.it/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=3370&creative=24114&linkCode=ur2&tag={{ site.constants.amazon_it }}), [Amazon FR](https://www.amazon.fr/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1642&creative=19458&linkCode=ur2&tag={{ site.constants.amazon_fr }}), and [Amazon ES](https://www.amazon.es/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=3626&creative=24822&linkCode=ur2&tag={{ site.constants.amazon_es }}). Sometimes, the same product is cheaper elsewhere.

3. **Beware of Customs Fees**  
   Buying from Amazon UK post-Brexit? Customs fees can turn a bargain into a nightmare. Always check the final price before confirming your order.

4. **Use Amazon Currency Converter**  
   Avoid surprises by using the built-in currency converter. But here's the catch: Amazon's exchange rates aren't always the best. Compare with your bank's rates to see which is cheaper.

5. **Stick to Amazon-Handled Products**  
   Third-party sellers can be hit or miss. If Amazon handles the shipping, you're safer. Otherwise, prepare for separate shipping fees and potential headaches.

6. **Track Prices with {{ site.constants.wsibname }}**  
   Use tools like [{{ site.constants.wsibname }}]({{ site.constants.wsib }}) to monitor price drops. Why pay full price when you can wait for a deal?

7. **Be Patient**  
   Prices fluctuate constantly. Use price tracking tools to buy when the price is right. Remember, patience is a virtue—especially when it saves you money.

8. **Check Reviews and Ratings**  
   Don't trust a product with no reviews or low ratings. And beware of fake reviews—yes, they exist, even on Amazon.

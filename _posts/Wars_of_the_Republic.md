## The Macedonian Wars

### Clash of Titans

The Macedonian Wars saw Rome clashing with the Hellenistic kingdoms. It was like an ancient Avengers movie – gods, heroes, and epic battles.

### Rome's Ascendancy

By the end of the Macedonian Wars, Rome had firmly established itself as the dominant power in the Mediterranean. They were the Tony Stark of the ancient world – smart, strategic, and a bit cocky.

## Spells Galore!

### A Spell for Every Occasion

The **Street Grimoire** is brimming with spells. Need to fry an enemy's brain? There's a spell for that. Want to turn invisible and sneak past security? Got you covered. Feeling a bit peckish? There's probably a spell for that too (though it might taste like soy).

### Favorite Spells

Here are a few of our favorites:

- **Turn to Goo**: Because sometimes, turning your enemies into a puddle of goo is the best solution.
- **Petrify**: For those moments when you need to make a quick getaway and leave someone as a lawn ornament.
- **Fireball**: A classic for a reason. Who doesn't love a good explosion?
- **Magic Fingers**: For when you need to do delicate work from a distance. Or, you know, give someone a magical noogie.

## Traditions and Societies

### Magical Traditions

The **Street Grimoire** introduces a plethora of magical traditions, each with its own unique flavor and mechanics. Whether you're a Hermetic mage, a Shaman, or a Chaos magician, there's something here for you.

### Magical Societies

Join a magical society and gain access to unique spells, resources, and allies. From the mysterious Illuminates of the New Dawn to the brutal Blood Mages, the choices are as diverse as they are dangerous.

## Adept Powers and Mentor Spirits

### Adept Powers

Adepts get a lot of love in this book. With new powers that enhance their physical and magical abilities, they'll be punching, kicking, and spell-slinging their way to victory.

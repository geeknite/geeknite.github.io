## What is Don't Mess With Cthulhu Deluxe?

"Don't Mess With Cthulhu Deluxe" is a social deduction game with a twist of Lovecraftian horror. Players take on the roles of Investigators and Cultists, trying to either save the world or summon the big tentacled guy himself. The Deluxe edition adds new content, including roles, cards, and ways to mess with your friends (or enemies).

### Components

The game comes with beautifully illustrated cards, tokens, and a rulebook that's detailed enough to make you think twice about your life choices. The artwork captures the dark and mysterious essence of the Lovecraftian universe, making you feel like you're one cryptic clue away from madness.

**Pro Tip**: Keep a flashlight handy. You might need it for dramatic effect or finding lost sanity tokens.

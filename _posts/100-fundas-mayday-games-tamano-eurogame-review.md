## Cons of Using Mayday Games Eurogame Sleeves

### The Sleeved Cardzilla Effect

Once your cards are sleeved, they tend to stack up like a skyscraper. Finding a storage solution that doesn't involve a construction permit can be challenging.

### Sleeving Addiction

Sleeving can become a compulsive habit. Once you start, you'll end up sleeving cards for games you haven't even played yet. Welcome to the sleeving rabbit hole.

### Shuffling Woes

While shuffling sleeved cards is magical, it can also cause a card explosion if not done properly. Your friends might think you’ve invented a new way to play 52-card pick-up.

### Expense

Though economical, buying sleeves for an extensive collection can add up. Next thing you know, you've spent more on sleeves than on the games themselves. Oops!

## Practical Tips for Sleeving

### Sleeve Your Most Played Games

Start with the games you play most often. If you hardly play a game, it might not be worth the time and money to sleeve it. Save your sleeves for the games that see the most action.

### Invest in Premium Sleeves

For your most valued games, consider upgrading to premium sleeves. They offer better durability and feel like your cards are wrapped in velvet.

### Organize Sleeved Decks

Use card dividers or deck boxes to keep your sleeved cards organized. This prevents the sleeved Cardzilla effect and makes setup easier.

### Shuffle Like a Pro

Learn the art of shuffling sleeved cards. There are tutorials online, or you can just channel your inner magician and hope for the best.

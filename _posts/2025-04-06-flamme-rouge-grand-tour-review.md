### What is Flamme Rouge?

*Flamme Rouge* is a strategic cycling board game that simulates the thrilling final stages of a bicycle race. Each player manages a team of two cyclists (a rouleur and a sprinteur) and must strategically maneuver them to be the first to cross the finish line. The game involves drafting, energy management, and tactical positioning, making it a perfect blend of strategy and excitement.

### Gameplay Mechanics

The game is played over a series of rounds, with each player choosing a movement card for their cyclists each turn. The game board features various track layouts that can be customized for different races, adding replayability and variety.

- **Movement Cards**: Each player has a deck of movement cards for their rouleur and sprinteur. These cards dictate how far each cyclist moves each turn. Players must carefully manage their energy and plan their moves to outmaneuver opponents and avoid exhaustion.
- **Drafting**: Just like in real cycling, drafting behind other cyclists can help conserve energy. Positioning your cyclists in the right place at the right time is crucial for success.
- **Exhaustion Cards**: Cyclists who end their turn at the front of a pack receive exhaustion cards, which are less effective and can hinder their performance in later stages of the race.

### The Grand Tour Expansion

The *Grand Tour* expansion adds new layers of complexity and excitement to *Flamme Rouge*. It introduces multi-stage races, team management, and new strategic elements that make the game even more engaging.

- **Multi-Stage Races**: Players can now compete in a series of races, with cumulative results determining the overall winner. This adds a campaign-like feel to the game, making it even more immersive.
- **Team Management**: The expansion allows players to manage a team of cyclists, each with unique abilities and characteristics. Balancing the strengths and weaknesses of your team is key to victory.
- **New Track Elements**: The *Grand Tour* expansion includes new track pieces, such as cobblestones and mountain passes, which add variety and challenge to the races.

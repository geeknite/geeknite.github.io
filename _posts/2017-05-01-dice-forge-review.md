## Introduction

Welcome, fellow dice-rollers, to the wondrous world of **Dice Forge**! If you love board games that combine strategy, luck, and shiny objects (aka dice), then you're in for a treat. **Dice Forge** is a game where you can literally craft your own dice, and let's be honest, who hasn't dreamed of that?

## What is Dice Forge?

**Dice Forge** is a strategic dice-building game where you play as demigods competing to gain the favor of the gods. How do you do this? By collecting resources, completing heroic feats, and most importantly, forging and upgrading your own dice. It's like being a divine blacksmith, but with less sweat and more divine glory.

### Components

The game comes with:
- **Customizable Dice**: The stars of the show. These dice have removable faces that you can swap out to improve your rolls.
- **Game Board**: A beautifully illustrated board that represents various celestial islands where you perform your heroic feats.
- **Heroic Feat Cards**: These cards provide powerful abilities and bonuses that can turn the tide in your favor.
- **Resource Tokens**: Gold, moon shards, and sun shards. Collect these to upgrade your dice and perform feats.

**Pro Tip**: Make sure you have nimble fingers for swapping out those dice faces. Or just use tweezers, no judgment here.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up **Dice Forge** is like preparing for a divine festival. Lay out the game board, distribute starting resources, and give each player their customizable dice. Then, let the divine competition begin!

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, you roll your dice to collect resources. You can then spend these resources to either upgrade your dice or perform heroic feats. The key is to balance your resource collection with your dice upgrades to maximize your divine potential.

### Dice Forging

The unique mechanic of **Dice Forge** is, of course, the forging of dice. Use your resources to buy new dice faces and snap them onto your dice. It's incredibly satisfying to click those faces into place and watch your dice evolve into powerful tools of destiny.

**Funny Moment**: During one game, a player accidentally sent a dice face flying across the room while trying to swap it out. We spent more time searching for the lost piece than playing the actual game. Pro Tip: Always have a backup dice face.

## The Divine Competition

### Heroic Feats

Completing heroic feats is how you score victory points in **Dice Forge**. Each feat card offers unique bonuses, and timing your feats just right can give you the edge over your opponents. Just remember, divine glory waits for no one.

### Strategy and Luck

While luck plays a role in dice rolls, the strategic element of upgrading your dice adds depth to the game. You need to think carefully about which faces to buy and when to upgrade to outmaneuver your rivals.

**Pro Tip**: Don't neglect your resource collection dice faces. Getting tons of resources early can set you up for a powerful late game.

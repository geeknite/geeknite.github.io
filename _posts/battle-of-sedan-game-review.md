## The Basics

### What is Battle of Sedan?

It includes detailed miniatures of soldiers, cavalry, and artillery, along with a deck of cards featuring events, tactics, and historical figures. The artwork and components are top-notch, making the game visually stunning and immersive.

**Fun Fact**: The game includes a special "Napoleon III" miniature that will make you shout "Vive l'Empereur!" every time it appears.

## Gameplay

Battle of Sedan is all about strategy, tactical thinking, and occasionally laughing at your opponent's misfortune. Players must maneuver their armies, use terrain to their advantage, and deploy various tactics to outsmart the enemy. Each player takes on the role of a commander, with unique abilities and special cards that can turn the tide of battle.

## What is WW1 Wings of Glory?

WW1 Wings of Glory is a tabletop game that simulates aerial combat during World War I. Players take control of famous aircraft like the Fokker Dr.I and Sopwith Camel, maneuvering them through the skies in intense dogfights. With detailed miniatures, realistic movement mechanics, and a dash of historical flavor, this game offers an immersive experience for aviation buffs and gamers alike.

### The Duel Pack

The **Duel Pack** brings together two of the most iconic fighters of WW1: the Fokker Dr.I, famously flown by the Red Baron, and the Sopwith Camel, the Allies' trusty steed. Each aircraft comes with its own set of unique abilities and maneuvers, making every game a test of skill and strategy.

## Gameplay

### Setup

Setting up WW1 Wings of Glory is like preparing for a miniature airshow. You'll need to lay out the game mat, place your aircraft miniatures, and set up the maneuver decks. Pro tip: make airplane noises while doing this for maximum immersion.

### Turn Phases

Each turn consists of several phases:

1. **Planning Phase**: Players secretly choose their aircraft's maneuvers using maneuver cards.
2. **Movement Phase**: Reveal and execute maneuvers, moving your aircraft across the game mat.
3. **Combat Phase**: Engage in dogfights, rolling dice to determine hits and damage.

### Winning and Losing

To win, players must shoot down their opponent's aircraft while keeping their own plane in one piece. If your pilot takes too much damage or ends up in an unfavorable position, it may be curtains for your flying ace.

**Pro Tip**: Always keep an eye on your altitude – it's not just about moving forward, but also up and down!

At first glance, the Bolsa Zip is as unassuming as a bag can be. Measuring a modest 8.5 x 13.3 cm, it’s the perfect size for storing small items like coins, keys, or that secret stash of candy you don't want your coworkers to find.

The material is surprisingly durable, considering its size. The zip mechanism is smooth, and the stitching is tight enough to handle the rigors of daily use. It’s like the superhero of small storage, ready to keep your essentials safe from the chaos of your pockets.

**Verdict:** The Bolsa Zip scores high on first impressions. It’s small but built to last.

## **Functionality: Does Size Matter?**

This multi-headed beast is ready to wreak havoc on any tabletop campaign.

### Design and Detail

The level of detail on the Hydra Figurine is nothing short of extraordinary. Each head has a unique expression, ranging from "I'm going to eat you" to "I'm going to eat you harder." The scales are intricately sculpted, and the paint job is top-notch, making this miniature a true work of art.

Imagine your players' faces when this behemoth slithers onto the battlefield – priceless!

### Durability

Made from high-quality materials, this figurine can withstand the rigors of intense gaming sessions, accidental drops, and even the occasional "I rage-quit and flip the table" moments. It's built to last, just like your character's unresolved daddy issues.

### Versatility

While it's designed for the Mythic Odysseys of Theros campaign, the Hydra Figurine is versatile enough to be used in various other settings and stories.

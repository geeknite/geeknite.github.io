## Introduction

Hey there, fellow brick enthusiasts! Grab your wolf pack and howl at the moon because today we're diving into the wild world of LEGO 21261 La Fortaleza-Lobo. If you're a fan of majestic fortresses and fierce wolves (and who isn’t?), this set is going to blow your mind and possibly your budget.

## The Set: Overview and First Impressions

So, what's the buzz about LEGO 21261? With over 1,500 pieces, this set doesn’t just give you a fortress; it offers an entire ecosystem for your wolf pack to rule over. From intricate walls to hidden traps, this fortress is designed to keep invaders out and the wolves in. And let's face it, every kid (and adult) has dreamt of commanding a wolf pack!

### Main Features

- **Piece Count:** 1,500+ (Brace yourselves for a few missing pieces, it's all part of the adventure!)
- **Minifigures:** Includes 3 wolves, 2 guards, and one suspiciously heroic knight
- **Fortress Amenities:** Secret rooms, trap doors, and tactical hideouts

## Building Experience

### Initial Setup

When you first open the box, you’ll likely feel both excitement and a bit of dread. The manual is as thick as a medieval tome, but don’t worry, it’s filled with step-by-step instructions and occasionally humorous illustrations of what NOT to do.

### The Nitty-Gritty

Building LEGO 21261 is a marathon, not a sprint. Expect to spend at least 8-10 hours piecing this fortress together. And remember, Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither will your wolfish fortress.

### Highlights

### Cons

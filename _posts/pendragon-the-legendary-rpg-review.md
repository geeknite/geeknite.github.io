# Pendragon: The Legendary RPG Review

Alright fellow knights and damsels, gather 'round, because today we’re diving into the mystical and chivalrous world of *Pendragon*, a tabletop RPG that takes your Arthurian fantasies and cranks them up to 11. It's time to don your armor, mount your steed, and probably get into an argument with a dragon. Let's see if this game is worthy of a place at the Round Table!

## The Basics of Pendragon

### What is Pendragon?

*Pendragon* is a tabletop role-playing game created by Greg Stafford in 1985. It's like Dungeons & Dragons but with more courtly love, less fireballs, and a lot more jousting. In this game, players take on the roles of knights in the mythical kingdom of Camelot, serving King Arthur, undertaking quests, and upholding the ideals of chivalry (or at least trying not to get killed by a giant or something).

### Setting and Atmosphere

The game is set in a romanticized version of medieval Britain, where magic is real, and honor and valor are the currencies of the day. It’s like *Game of Thrones* without all the existential dread, or *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* but with fewer coconuts and more actual horses.

> “You don’t just play a knight in Pendragon; you become one. And then, you know, probably get eaten by a dragon or something.” - Greg Stafford, probably.

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Character Creation

Creating a character in *Pendragon* involves rolling up a noble knight with a detailed family history, personality traits, passions, and virtues. It's kind of like making a LinkedIn profile for someone who fights dragons. You’ll decide things like your knight's loyalty to their lord, their piety, and whether they think it’s okay to eat with their hands at dinner parties.

**Example:** Sir Bumblesnort of Wibblebottom, a valiant knight known for his loyalty, bravery, and unwarranted fear of squirrels.

### The Great Pendragon Campaign

One of the most impressive features of *Pendragon* is its epic campaign that spans decades. Your knight will grow old, have children, and probably develop a drinking problem because medieval life is tough. This generational play means you could start with Sir Bumblesnort and end up playing his grandchild, Sir Bumblesnort III: The Reckoning.

### Combat and Jousting

Combat in *Pendragon* is brutal and realistic. Forget about swinging from chandeliers or dodging arrows with a backflip. Here, you’ll face the grim reality of medieval warfare, where one wrong move can end with you as a kebab. Jousting tournaments are a big deal too – think of it as the medieval equivalent of Monday Night Football.

## What Makes Pendragon Special?

### Emphasis on Role-Playing

If you’re the kind of player who enjoys deep character development, personal quests, and the occasional moral dilemma, *Pendragon* is your jam. The game encourages you to get into the mindset of a knight and make decisions based on your character’s virtues and flaws. Are you brave enough to face the dragon, or will you flee and bring shame to your house?

### Historical and Mythical Blend

*Pendragon* seamlessly blends historical facts with Arthurian legend, creating a rich tapestry of storytelling potential. Whether you’re dealing with the politics of medieval courts or hunting for the Holy Grail, the game provides a deep, immersive experience.

### The Book of Knights & Ladies

This supplement expands the game, providing more options for character creation, including different cultures and roles beyond the typical knight. Now you can have Lady Guinevere’s cousin’s best friend’s dog walker as a character, and it’ll still be awesome.

## The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly

### The Good

- **Deep, Immersive Role-Playing:** The game's emphasis on character and story over dice-rolling combat makes for a rich role-playing experience.
- **Generational Play:** The ability to play through multiple generations of knights is unique and adds depth to the campaign.
- **Rich Lore:** The blend of history and legend provides a compelling backdrop for adventures.

### The Bad

- **Complex Rules:** The game’s rules can be complex and daunting for beginners. You might spend more time flipping through the rulebook than actually slaying dragons.
- **High Mortality:** Knights can die easily, which can be frustrating for players who get attached to their characters.

### The Ugly

- **Jousting Mechanics:** While jousting is cool, the mechanics can be repetitive and sometimes feel like a medieval version of rock-paper-scissors.

## Conclusion and Recommendation

*Pendragon* is a game for those who love deep role-playing, rich storytelling, and the Arthurian mythos. It's not for the faint of heart (or those who hate flipping through rulebooks), but if you’re willing to dive in, you’ll find a rewarding and immersive experience. It's a fantastic game for anyone looking to add a bit of chivalry and adventure to their tabletop sessions.

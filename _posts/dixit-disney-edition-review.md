## What is Dixit Disney Edition?

Dixit Disney Edition is the latest enchanting expansion of the popular storytelling game *Dixit*. This time, the game brings the magic of Disney to your tabletop, with beautifully illustrated cards featuring beloved characters and scenes from Disney movies.

### Components

The game includes:

- **Illustrated Cards**: Each card is a mini work of art, featuring scenes and characters from various Disney movies. They're so detailed you'll want to frame them.
- **Game Board**: A whimsical Disney-themed board where players move their tokens.
- **Tokens**: Disney-themed tokens for scoring and tracking.
- **Instructions**: Clear and concise rules to get you started on your magical adventure.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up Dixit Disney Edition is like preparing for a Disney movie marathon. Lay out the game board, distribute the cards and tokens, and choose your storyteller. Now you're ready to begin your magical journey.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, the storyteller selects a card and provides a clue based on the illustration. The other players then select cards from their hands that they think match the clue. The goal is to guess the storyteller’s card while avoiding the traps set by other players.

### Scoring

Scoring in Dixit Disney Edition is straightforward but strategic. Points are awarded for correctly guessing the storyteller’s card and tricking other players into selecting your card. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

## Disney Magic

### Characters and Scenes

One of the best parts of Dixit Disney Edition is the diverse range of characters and scenes. From Elsa and Olaf to Simba and Mufasa, you can play with cards featuring your favorite Disney characters and relive iconic movie moments.

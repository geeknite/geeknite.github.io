**Hello Geeknite readers!** Today, we're diving into the future with a review of the latest and greatest in foldable technology – the Samsung Galaxy S24. It's 2026, and Samsung is pushing the boundaries of what a smartphone can be. But is the Galaxy S24 worth your hard-earned credits? Let's find out!

## **Design and Build Quality**

The Samsung Galaxy S24 is a stunner from every angle. With its sleek foldable design and premium materials, it's a gadget that screams luxury. The hinge mechanism is smoother than a Jedi mind trick, and the phone feels solid in both folded and unfolded states. Available in Galactic Black, Space Silver, and Nebula Blue, there's a color for every aspiring space traveler.

## **Display**

The Galaxy S24 sports a 7.6-inch AMOLED display when unfolded, with a resolution of 3200x1800 pixels. The colors are vibrant, the blacks are deep, and the 120Hz refresh rate makes everything look smoother than a lightsaber duel. When folded, the cover display is a handy 6.2 inches, perfect for quick tasks and checking notifications.

## **Performance**

Under the hood, the Galaxy S24 is powered by the Exynos 1000 processor (or Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, depending on your region), coupled with up to 12GB of RAM. Multitasking is a breeze, and you can run multiple apps without feeling like you're operating a droid from the junkyard. Gaming performance is stellar, with no noticeable lag even on the most demanding titles.

## **Camera**

Samsung has equipped the Galaxy S24 with a versatile quad-camera setup: a 108MP main sensor, a 12MP ultra-wide lens, a 10MP telephoto lens, and a 5MP macro shooter. It's like having a professional camera crew in your pocket. The night mode is particularly impressive, capturing stunning shots even in the darkest cantinas. Selfies are handled by a 32MP front camera that makes you look out of this world.

## **Battery Life**

One of the standout features of the Galaxy S24 is its battery life. The 5000mAh battery easily lasts a full day of heavy use, even with the large foldable display. Plus, with 45W fast charging, you'll be back to exploring the galaxy in no time.

## **Software**

The Galaxy S24 runs One UI 5 based on Android 13. It's packed with features that make the most of the foldable form factor, such as multi-window support and app continuity. The software experience is smooth, though Samsung's bloatware can be a bit overwhelming at times.

## **Price and Availability**

Priced at around $2000, the Galaxy S24 is not for the faint of heart (or wallet). It's available globally, and you can snag it on platforms like [eBay and Amazon]({{ site.constants.wsib }}samsung-galaxy-s24).

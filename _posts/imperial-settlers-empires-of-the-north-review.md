## The Basics

### What is Imperial Settlers: Empires of the North?

Imperial Settlers: Empires of the North is a standalone card game that builds on the mechanics of the original Imperial Settlers. Players take control of different factions, each with unique abilities and strategies, as they expand their empires in the snowy north.

### Components

The game includes:
- **Faction Decks**: Each faction has its own deck of cards representing buildings, actions, and characters.
- **Island Cards**: Explore and conquer islands to gain resources and bonuses.
- **Tokens and Markers**: Track resources, progress, and effects during the game.
- **Game Board**: The central board where players place their tokens and plan their actions.

**Pro Tip**: Keep an eye on those Viking tokens. They like to raid your perfectly constructed empire when you least expect it.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up Empires of the North is like preparing for a grand feast. Lay out the game board, distribute faction decks, and shuffle the island cards. Choose your faction, and let the icy conquest begin!

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players draw cards and perform actions based on their faction's abilities. You can build structures, gather resources, explore islands, and sometimes even raid your opponents. Cooperation is key, but betrayal is always an option.

### Combat and Conquest

Combat in Empires of the North is a mix of strategy and luck. Each faction has unique abilities that add twists to the game. Did you plan an epic raid only to find the island already occupied? Welcome to the north, where plans often go awry.

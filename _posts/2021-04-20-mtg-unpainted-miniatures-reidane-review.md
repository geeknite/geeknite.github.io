## Introduction

Welcome to another magical review, fellow Planeswalkers and miniature enthusiasts! Today, we're diving into the divine realms of Magic the Gathering's unpainted miniatures, specifically focusing on **Reidane, Goddess of Justice** from **Wave 14**. Prepare yourself for a journey that combines creativity, justice, and a touch of humor—because what's a goddess without a sense of humor?

## Overview of the Miniature

### Who is Reidane, Goddess of Justice?

Reidane, Goddess of Justice, is a character from Magic the Gathering's Kaldheim set. Known for her unwavering sense of fairness and her ability to wield justice like a shimmering sword, Reidane is a force to be reckoned with. Her unpainted miniature captures this essence beautifully, even if she looks like she just stepped out of a monochromatic film noir.

### The Miniature Details

The unpainted miniature of Reidane stands at a mighty 35mm, making her an imposing figure among your collection. Her intricate armor and detailed facial features make her a perfect candidate for painters looking to test their skills.

## Painting Possibilities

### Unleash Your Inner Artist

Painting Reidane is like crafting justice with every stroke of your brush. The miniature's details provide ample opportunities for shading, highlighting, and getting lost in a creative trance. From her regal armor to the flowing cape, you'll find plenty of surfaces to practice your techniques.

### Color Choices

While Reidane traditionally sports a metallic silver and gold palette, don't be afraid to channel your inner Bob Ross and experiment. Perhaps she needs a splash of neon pink to truly stand out in the battlefield (and in your nightmares).

## Quality and Craftsmanship

### The Good

The quality of Reidane's unpainted miniature is top-notch. The casting is clean with minimal mold lines, allowing for a smooth painting experience. The details are crisp, which is essential for achieving that "I spent hours on this" look.

### The Not-So-Good

However, no miniature is perfect. Some might find the smaller details challenging to paint, especially if you're newer to the hobby. But hey, justice isn't easy—neither is painting her representation.

## Funny Painting Stories

### Justice Served with a Side of Chaos

During a painting session, one of our team members decided to give Reidane a rainbow-colored shield. Let's just say that the goddess of justice looked more like the goddess of carnivals. Lesson learned: stick to the theme (unless you're really into rainbows).

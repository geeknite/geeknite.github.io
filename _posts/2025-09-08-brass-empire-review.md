If you've ever wanted to command a steampunk empire while dealing with industrial sabotage and hilarious mishaps, then this game is tailor-made for you.

## The Basics

### What is Brass Empire?

Brass Empire is a deck-building and strategy board game set in a steampunk universe. Designed by Louie DeRosa, this game allows players to take control of one of five corporate factions, each vying for dominance in the industrial age. With unique abilities, units, and resources, players must build their empire while sabotaging their opponents.

### Components

The game comes with beautifully designed cards, representing various units, resources, and events. The artwork captures the essence of the steampunk theme perfectly, and the high-quality components ensure an immersive gaming experience. The game also includes various tokens, a rulebook, and faction boards with detailed information about each faction's strengths and weaknesses.

## Gameplay

### Setting Up

Setting up Brass Empire is straightforward. Each player selects a faction and receives their starting deck of cards. The game board is laid out, and resource tokens are distributed. The objective is to accumulate victory points by building units, acquiring resources, and completing objectives.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players draw cards from their deck and use them to perform actions such as deploying units, gathering resources, and sabotaging opponents. Strategic decisions are crucial, as players must balance their empire's growth with the need to hinder their rivals.

### Steampunk Strategy

Brass Empire shines in its strategic depth. Players must carefully plan their moves, utilize their faction's unique abilities, and think several steps ahead to outwit their opponents. Cooperation and deception are key components, and you'll need to communicate effectively and anticipate your rivals' tactics.

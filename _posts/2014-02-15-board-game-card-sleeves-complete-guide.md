## The Great Debate: To Sleeve or Not to Sleeve?

### Compelling Arguments FOR Sleeving

**Protection Benefits:**
- **Longevity:** Sleeved cards last 5-10Ã— longer than unsleeved
- **Resale Value:** Protected games maintain higher market value
- **Hygiene:** Barrier against germs and oils
- **Shuffling Quality:** Smoother shuffling experience
- **Consistency:** All cards feel identical (prevents marked cards)

**Practical Advantages:**
- **Spill Recovery:** Liquid wipes off sleeves without damage
- **Component Replacement:** Easier to replace damaged sleeves than cards
- **Investment Protection:** Protects $50-150+ game purchases
- **Peace of Mind:** Play without anxiety about card condition

**Statistical Reality:**
- **Unsleeved cards** show visible wear after 20-30 plays
- **Sleeved cards** maintain pristine condition for 200+ plays
- **Premium games** ($80+) often cost less to sleeve ($10-20) than replace

### Valid Arguments AGAINST Sleeving

**Practical Challenges:**
- **Storage Issues:** Sleeved cards increase box size 40-60%
- **Cost Accumulation:** Sleeving full collection can exceed $500+
- **Time Investment:** Sleeving 300-card game takes 30-45 minutes
- **Shuffling Learning Curve:** Sleeved cards shuffle differently
- **Box Compatibility:** May not fit original inserts

**Philosophical Considerations:**
- **Tactile Experience:** Some prefer feel of bare cardboard
- **Gaming Purists:** "Games are meant to be played, not preserved"
- **Analysis Paralysis:** Which games to sleeve first?
- **Environmental Concerns:** Plastic waste from sleeves

> **Pro Tip:** The optimal strategy is selective sleevingâ€”protect frequently played games and expensive titles, leave casual/light games unsleeved to save money and storage space.

- Irreplaceable vintage/out-of-print titles
- Your #1 favorite game of all time

**Tier 2: Quality Sleeving (FFG/Mayday Premium)**

- Cooperative games with heavy handling
- Games with card-drawing mechanics
- Collection centerpieces

**Tier 3: Budget Sleeving (Mayday Standard/BCW)**
- Monthly play games ($20-40 range)
- Deck-building games (large card counts)
- Games with built-in card protection
- Testing before premium investment

**Tier 4: No Sleeving**
- Party games (Werewolf, Codenames)
- Games with thick/coated cards
- Children's games (expect damage)
- Games with included sleeves
- Very infrequent play (<5Ã— per year)

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Example: Sleeving Agricola (Eurogame)**
- **Card Count:** ~360 cards (base game)
- **Sleeve Needs:** 4 packs Ã— 100 (59Ã—92mm)
- **Cost Options:**
  * Budget (Mayday Standard): 4 Ã— â‚¬3 = **â‚¬12**
  * Mid-Tier (Mayday Premium): 4 Ã— â‚¬6 = **â‚¬24**
  * Premium (FFG): 8 Ã— â‚¬5 = **â‚¬40**

**Value Calculation:**
- **Game Replacement Cost:** â‚¬50
- **Expected Plays Unsleeved:** 30-40 before noticeable wear

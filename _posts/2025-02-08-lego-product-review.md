## Introduction

Hello, fellow gamers! Are you ready to uncover the secrets of **Mysterium Park**? Well, grab your detective hat and get ready to laugh and shiver simultaneously, because this board game is all about mystery, ghosts, and a touch of humor.

## The Basics of Mysterium Park

Mysterium Park is a cooperative board game designed for 2-6 players. The game revolves around solving the mystery of the park's former director's disappearance while communicating with a ghost who provides clues. Think of it as "Clue" meets "Poltergeist," but without the need for a séance (unless you want to add that for extra flair).

### Components

The game comes with a beautifully designed board featuring various locations within the park, a deck of vision cards, character cards, and other essential components that bring the mystery to life. The artwork is top-notch, and you'll find yourself getting lost in the eerie details.

**Fun Fact**: The game includes a screen for the ghost player, adding a layer of secrecy and suspense that will keep everyone on their toes.

## Gameplay

Mysterium Park is all about communication, deduction, and occasional laughter. Players must work together to interpret the clues given by the ghost and eliminate suspects and locations to solve the mystery. Each player takes on the role of a psychic investigator with unique abilities.

### Turn Phases

Each turn consists of several phases:

1. **Vision Phase**: The ghost player provides vision cards to the investigators.
2. **Deduction Phase**: Investigators discuss and interpret the visions to eliminate suspects and locations.
3. **Elimination Phase**: Based on the discussions, investigators eliminate suspects or locations.

### Winning and Losing

To win, players must correctly identify the suspect and location before the week ends. If the investigators fail to solve the mystery within the allotted time, it's game over. Better luck next time, psychic detectives.

**Pro Tip**: Pay close attention to the ghost's clues, but don't forget to have fun and enjoy the wild guesses and hilarious interpretations that ensue.

## Mysterium Park: The Humor Factor

One of the best aspects of Mysterium Park is the humor built into the gameplay. From the quirky vision cards to the amusing discussions and wild guesses, there's never a dull moment. The game embraces the absurdity of communicating with a ghost, and you'll find yourself laughing as much as deducing.

**Funny Moment**: During one game, our ghost provided a vision card featuring a giant octopus. The investigator immediately guessed "Octopus sushi restaurant," which was completely off-track but had everyone in stitches.

## Pros and Cons

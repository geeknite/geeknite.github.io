## Performance

### Light Output

This lamp doesn't just look good; it performs exceptionally well too. It provides a warm, inviting glow that's perfect for reading, working, or setting the mood for a cozy evening. The lampshade diffuses the light beautifully, making sure it's not too harsh on the eyes.

## Criticism

### The Not-So-Good

While this lamp is impressive, it's not without its flaws. Some users have reported that the lampshade can be a bit tricky to clean – dust and grime seem to love it as much as we do.

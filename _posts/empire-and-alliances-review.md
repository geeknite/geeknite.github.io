### What is Empire and Alliances?

Empire and Alliances is a strategy game that plunges you into the heart of political maneuvering and global conquest.

Plus, you get to make alliances, which is always fun until someone inevitably backstabs you. Ah, friendship.

### Diplomacy

Diplomacy is a key aspect of Empire and Alliances. You must negotiate with other players to form alliances, prevent wars, and trade resources. It's interesting how quickly “I’ll never betray you” can turn into “Oops, my troops accidentally invaded your territory.” Classic.

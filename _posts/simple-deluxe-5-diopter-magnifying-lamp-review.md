The lamp is equipped with energy-efficient LED lights that provide a bright, white illumination. This is perfect for working in dimly lit environments or for those late-night geeky projects when you suddenly decide to fix your vintage gaming console at 2 AM.

### Adjustable Arm

The lamp features an adjustable arm that allows you to position the magnifying glass exactly where you need it. Whether you're soldering circuit boards, painting tiny miniatures for your next D&D campaign, or just trying to read the ingredients on your favorite snack, this lamp has got your back.

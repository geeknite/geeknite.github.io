## What is Struggle of Empires Deluxe?

Struggle of Empires Deluxe is the revamped edition of the classic game by Martin Wallace. This version includes metal coins, which elevate the tactile experience to new heights. The game revolves around building empires, forming alliances, and battling for supremacy in Europe during the 18th century.

### Components

The game comes with:
- **Metal Coins**: These gleaming beauties are a significant upgrade from cardboard tokens. They make hoarding wealth feel oh-so-good.
- **Game Board**: A beautifully designed map of Europe.
- **Miniatures**: Representing armies and fleets.
- **Cards**: For events, alliances, and special actions.
- **Tokens**: Tracking various game elements (and causing chaos).

**Pro Tip**: Keep your coins away from your cat. Unless you want to spend the game searching for your stolen wealth.

## Gameplay

### Setup

Setting up Struggle of Empires Deluxe requires some time and patience. You'll need to lay out the game board, distribute coins, miniatures, and cards, and prepare for a strategic battle. Snacks are optional but highly recommended.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players take actions such as forming alliances, building armies, and waging war. The game is heavily reliant on diplomacy, so be prepared for some intense negotiations (and inevitable betrayals).

### Combat

Combat is resolved using dice rolls and strategic positioning. Did you expect your massive army to crush your opponent, only to roll a string of ones? Welcome to the chaotic world of warfare.

## The Deluxe Experience

One of the standout features of the Deluxe edition is the metal coins. They add a level of immersion and luxury to the game. Feel the weight of your empire’s wealth as you jingle your coins – it’s oddly satisfying.

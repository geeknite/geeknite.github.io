## Introduction

Hey there, fellow board game enthusiasts! Ready to build a civilization and make questionable architectural decisions? Today, we're diving into the world of **7 Wonders**, a game that combines strategy, resource management, and a healthy dose of "why the heck did I build that?"

If you love strategy games like [Marvel United Multiverse]({%- post_url 2023-08-15-marvel-united-multiverse-review -%}), you'll appreciate the intricate mechanics and endless replayability of 7 Wonders. Let's get our hard hats on and prepare for some serious city-building fun!

## What is 7 Wonders?

**7 Wonders** is a card drafting game designed by Antoine Bauza. It's played over three ages, allowing players to develop their civilization, build wonders, and collect victory points. Suitable for 2-7 players, each game takes about 30-45 minutes—perfect for a quick yet satisfying gaming session.

### Components

7 Wonders comes with:
- **Cards**: Representing various buildings, resources, and wonders.
- **Player Boards**: Each depicting one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.
- **Tokens**: Used to track resources, coins, and victory points.
- **Rulebook**: Surprisingly clear and concise for a game of this depth.

**Pro Tip**: Keep the cards away from your snack area. Greasy fingerprints might lead to accusations of cheating or worse, ruined artwork.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up 7 Wonders is like preparing a feast for your brain. Lay out the player boards, shuffle the age decks, and distribute initial resources. Choose your wonder and get ready to draft cards that will either make you a renowned architect or a glorified stone collector.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players draft a card from their hand and pass the remaining cards to the next player. The drafted card can be used to build structures, trade resources, or complete wonders. Strategic planning and anticipation are key, as each age brings new challenges and opportunities.

### Scoring

Scoring in 7 Wonders is a blend of strategy and satisfaction. Points are earned through completed wonders, buildings, military victories, and scientific achievements. Did your neighbor have more military might than you? Time to practice your "I totally didn't want to win that" face.

## The Wonders

### Building Your Wonders

One of the best parts of 7 Wonders is, of course, building your wonder. From the majestic Great Pyramid of Giza to the mysterious Hanging Gardens of Babylon, each wonder offers unique benefits and challenges.

**Funny Moment**: During one game, a player was so focused on completing the Colossus of Rhodes that they forgot to collect any resources. They ended up with a beautiful statue and a civilization living off air.

### Strategy Tips

- **Resource Management**: Balance resource acquisition with building advancements.
- **Military Might**: Don't ignore your military; those victory points can add up.
- **Scientific Achievements**: Aim for science cards to rake in points through combinations.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- **Engaging Gameplay**: The card drafting mechanic keeps players engaged and strategizing.
- **High Replayability**: Multiple strategies and wonders ensure no two games are alike.

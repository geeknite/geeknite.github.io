### Step 1: Installing Wishlist Manager

1. **Download the App**  
   Visit the [official homepage](https://wmhomepage.apphb.com/) or click the download button on the right panel. The ClickOnce installer will guide you through the process. Don't worry about the security warningâ€”WM doesn't ask for special permissions.

2. **Wait for Installation**  
   The app is lightweight, so installation should only take a few moments. If you encounter any issues, leave us a comment, and we'll help you out.

3. **Launch the App**  
   Once installed, WM will auto-launch. You'll also find a shortcut on your desktop and start menu. Feel free to delete the desktop icon if you're a neat freak.

### Step 2: Creating Your Wishlist

1. **Add Items**  
   Click the '+' icon and paste the Amazon product URL into the text box. WM will fetch the product details, including price, image, and a price history graph.

2. **Track Prices**  
   If the product is already in our database, you'll see its price history immediately. If not, WM will start tracking it for you. Check back in a few hours for updates.

3. **Import Amazon Wishlists**  
   Got a long wishlist? Make it public on Amazon, copy the link, and paste it into WM. The app will import all items automatically.

### Pro Tip: Privacy Matters

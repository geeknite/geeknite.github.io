Adult board games are fun and educational for children, and as such they are widely used in schools. It's hard to imagine how anyone could oppose allowing children to play board games in their homes without being accused of being anti-education.

However, board game advocates are well aware of the fact that this doesn't mean that we are "anti-education." Our main purpose is to create games that are fun, educational and accessible to a broad range of people. Board games can be used in schools as part of their curricula, but that doesn't mean they are compulsory. That would be a huge step backward from the role board games have been allowed to play in society.

To quote one of my favorite board games, "The game of war is no longer played for pleasure, it is played to win." Board games are played to win. But if you're playing a game for fun then the game is not fun and you should leave. That's a lot of hard work to make a fun game for your friends.

I say "games should be fun" but I don't mean to imply that if you want to play a game for fun you have to make your game "fun". If you want to make a game "fun" you have to understand what makes a game fun. What makes a game fun for me? It's about having fun. It's about trying new things. It's about seeing a good game through from start to finish. What makes a game fun for you?

It's about doing the things you love to do, whether it's watching a film or playing a game. It's about your friends. It's about people you don't know but you think you know them. It's about all the different things you might not know about the characters you love to watch. It's about the moments when you find out you're the person they thought you were. How do you think people respond to that? It is about enjoying things for the fun they are. You can be happy or sad or angry, but if you're just watching for the joy it brings, then you're missing something. Do you believe it's possible to have fun in all things.

## Introduction: Still a Loser in 2025

Hey there, fellow losers! Here we are in 2025, and guess what? **Amazon Prime is still a joke!** Despite the hefty subscription fees and all the hype, the so-called benefits are as fake as a three-euro coin. Allow me to break it down for you with a dash of humor and a sprinkle of sarcasm.

### Delivery in One Day (If You're Lucky)

Amazon promises one-day delivery, but let's be honest—**only if you live in a metropolis with unicorns and rainbows**. For those of us in towns or rural areas, good luck waiting for your packages. Sometimes it feels like they're shipped via carrier pigeon! 

### Streaming Content: More Like Screaming Content

If you thought the Amazon Prime Video catalog was going to improve, think again. Sure, there's more content, but the quality is still... questionable. **And don't forget the geo-restrictions**, so you can't watch everything you want. Thanks, Amazon! You can see everything they think is suitable for your country.

### Amazon Music App: Still a Disaster

The Amazon Music app is still the same mess it was years ago. It crashes, it slows down, and sometimes it doesn't play a single note. Seriously, Amazon? What happened to investing in user experience?

### Fake Reviews: As Real as a Unicorn

And let's not forget the fake reviews. Every time I buy something, I feel like I'm playing a lottery of lies. How does Amazon still get away with this? 

### Personal Data: Signing Your Life Away

Subscribing to Prime is like signing your life and privacy over to Jeff Bezos. **Amazon keeps collecting your data** like there's no tomorrow, and now they even know how many times a day you scratch your head. Do you want Amazon to know more about you than your therapist does? I don't!

### Price: Going Up Like My Blood Pressure

The subscription price has gone up and keeps climbing. Every year it's a new unpleasant surprise. Now it costs more than a gym membership, and it doesn't even help you build muscle—just spend more money.

### What to Do Next?

If after reading all this you still think Amazon Prime is worth it, [I recommend buying it here]({{ site.constants.wsib }}amazon prime). **But if you don't want to be robbed in broad daylight**, look for alternatives. There are plenty of other online stores offering good prices and not making you feel like an idiot.

**Take control of your shopping and don't let Amazon fool you!**

## Why Sleeve?

Let's face it, card games can get intense. You're shuffling, dealing, and sometimes spilling drinks (hopefully not on your cards). Sleeves are the superheroes in the world of board games, protecting your cards from wear, tear, and those unfortunate moments when someone decides to play while eating greasy snacks.

### Pros of Sleeving Your Cards

1. **Protection**: Keep your cards looking brand new, no matter how many times you play. No more worrying about bent corners or spilled drinks.
2. **Durability**: Sleeves can extend the life of your cards, saving you from having to replace them frequently.
3. **Premium Feel**: There's something satisfying about sleeving your cards. It feels like you're upgrading your game.
4. **Resale Value**: If you ever decide to part with your game, sleeved cards can fetch a higher price.

### Cons of Sleeving Your Cards

1. **Cost**: Sleeving can be expensive, especially if you have a large collection of games.
2. **Size**: Sleeved cards can be bulkier, sometimes making it harder to fit them back into the original box.
3. **Shuffling**: Some sleeves can be slippery, making shuffling a bit of a challenge.

## What is Citadel Shade: Targor Rageshade?

Citadel Shades are designed to add depth and shadow to your miniatures, providing that professional touch that makes your models look like they've just stepped off the battlefield into your display case. Targor Rageshade, in particular, promises to bring out the best (or worst, depending on how you look at it) of your chaos-fueled creations.

## Application and Results

### The Good

Applying Targor Rageshade is as simple as dunking a cookie in milk – if your cookie was a tiny plastic soldier and the milk was a dark, brooding shade of despair. The shade flows smoothly into the recesses, highlighting details like a spotlight on an actor’s face in a tragic play.

- **Coverage:** With a single brush stroke, Targor Rageshade can transform a bland model into a masterpiece of shadows and highlights. It’s like giving your miniatures a dramatic monologue without the need for voice lines.
- **Drying Time:** Surprisingly quick. You can watch the transformation happen almost in real-time, which is perfect for impatient hobbyists like myself.
- **Effect:** The end result is a stunning contrast that adds depth and realism. Your miniatures will look ready to conquer worlds and shatter dreams.

### The Not-So-Good

- **Overuse:** Not all shades are created equal, and Targor Rageshade can be a bit too dark if over-applied. You don’t want your miniature to look like it’s been rolling in soot all day.
- **Price:** It’s a bit on the pricey side. Then again, can you really put a price on the soul-crushing beauty of darkness?

## Funny Mishaps

Ah, the joys of miniature painting. If there’s one thing Targor Rageshade is good at, it’s turning your whites into goths. If you accidentally drop your brush, expect your pristine models to look like they’ve joined a heavy metal band overnight. But hey, happy accidents, right?

## Comparisons with Other Shades

### Nuln Oil

The classic, the legend, the oil that started it all. Nuln Oil is like the grandfather of shades, reliable and loved by all. However, Targor Rageshade brings a darker, more sinister vibe, perfect for those who want their miniatures to look like they’ve been through some rough intergalactic battles.

### Agrax Earthshade

The earthy sibling. Agrax Earthshade is great for natural, grounded effects, while Targor Rageshade is all about the dramatic shadows. Think of it as the difference between a nature documentary and a horror movie.

## Final Recommendation

If you’re looking to add a touch of darkness and drama to your miniatures, Targor Rageshade is a fantastic choice. Just remember, with great power comes great responsibility – don’t overdo it, or your miniature might end up looking like an extra in a horror flick.

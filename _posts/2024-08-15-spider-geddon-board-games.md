## What is Zombicide: Special Guest - Edouard Guiton Game Night Pack?

### The Basics

Zombicide is a cooperative board game where players take on the roles of survivors in a zombie apocalypse. Each player controls a character with unique abilities, working together to complete objectives while fending off hordes of zombies. The Edouard Guiton Game Night Pack introduces new characters, equipment, and scenarios designed to enhance the gameplay and bring fresh challenges to your Zombicide experience.

### Components

The Edouard Guiton Game Night Pack comes with beautifully designed miniatures, character cards, and equipment cards. The artwork by Guiton is top-notch, capturing the gritty and humorous essence of the Zombicide universe.

**Fun Fact**: One of the new characters, "Chef Gordon", comes with a spatula weapon card. Because nothing says zombie apocalypse like a good old-fashioned spatula smackdown.

## Gameplay

### Setting Up

Setting up the Edouard Guiton Game Night Pack is straightforward but requires careful planning. Lay out the new character cards and equipment, and shuffle the new scenario cards into your existing deck. Now you're ready to face the undead with a fresh set of challenges!

### Turn Phases

Each turn consists of several phases:

1. **Action Phase**: Players perform actions like moving, attacking, and using special abilities.
2. **Event Phase**: Draw event cards that introduce new challenges or spawn more zombies. (Because why not?)
3. **Zombie Phase**: Zombies move and attack. Prepare for chaos!

### Winning and Losing

To win, players must complete all objectives before the zombie invasion becomes too overwhelming. If the survivors are defeated or the zombie infestation reaches critical levels, it's game over. Sorry, humanity.

**Pro Tip**: Always keep the "Spatula of Doom" card handy. It may not save you, but it will give you a fighting chance.

The Edouard Guiton Game Night Pack embraces the absurdity of a zombie apocalypse, providing plenty of laugh-out-loud moments.

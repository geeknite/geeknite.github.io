## The Basics of Bears vs Babies

### What is Bears vs Babies?

*Bears vs Babies* is a card game created by the geniuses behind **Exploding Kittens**. It’s a fast-paced, party game where players build monstrous bears (and other creatures) to fight off hordes of creepy-cute babies. Trust me, it’s as absurd and fun as it sounds.

### Components

The game comes with a deck of cards, a playmat, and instructions, all packed in a furry box that makes you feel like you’re hugging an actual bear. The cards are divided into bear-building parts, baby armies, and special action cards.

**Fun Fact**: The furry box is a conversation starter. Just try bringing it to your next game night.

## Gameplay

### Setting Up

Setting up *Bears vs Babies* is a breeze. Lay out the playmat, shuffle the cards, and deal them to each player. Prepare for chaos, laughter, and possibly some strategic plotting.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players draw cards and use them to build their bear army or sabotage opponents. The goal is to create the strongest, most ridiculous bear possible to defeat the attacking babies. There are three types of baby armies: Land, Sea, and Air, and players must match their bears accordingly.

**Pro Tip**: Don’t underestimate the power of a bear with laser eyes.

### Combat

Combat happens when a player provokes the baby army. All players then unleash their bears to fight off the babies. The player with the strongest bear wins the battle and earns points.

**Funny Moment**: During one game, our laser-eyed bear was defeated by a baby with a trumpet. The humiliation was real.

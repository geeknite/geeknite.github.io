## Introduction

Hey Geeknite readers! Today, we're rewinding the tech clock and diving into the GoPro Hero4 Silver. This action camera has been around for a while, but does it still hold up in 2025? Spoiler alert: it’s still a gem, but let's break it down.

## Features

### Video Quality

The GoPro Hero4 Silver offers 1080p at 60fps, 720p at 120fps, and even 4K at 15fps. While it's not the latest 5.3K of the GoPro Hero 10 Black, the Hero4 Silver still delivers crispy and vibrant footage. If you're into slow-motion, the 120fps at 720p will make every splash and jump look epic.

### Photo Quality

With a 12MP camera, the Hero4 Silver captures stunning stills. The wide-angle lens ensures you get everything in the frame – perfect for those intense action shots or panoramic views.

### Touchscreen Display

One of the standout features is the built-in touchscreen display. You can preview shots, adjust settings, and playback footage – all without needing an external device. It's like having a mini cinema right on the back of your camera.

### Protune

For the budding Spielberg out there, Protune allows for manual control over color, ISO, exposure, and more. This feature turns your casual footage into professional-grade cinematography.

### Connectivity

The Hero4 Silver includes Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity. This makes it super easy to transfer files and control the camera remotely using the GoPro app. You can also hook it up to your smartphone for live streaming and instant sharing.

## Performance

### Durability

GoPro cameras are known for their ruggedness, and the Hero4 Silver is no exception. It's waterproof up to 40m (with the housing), so whether you're snorkeling, diving, or caught in a torrential downpour, this camera can handle it.

### Battery Life

The battery life is decent, offering around 1.5 to 2 hours of continuous recording on a full charge. While it’s not marathon-level endurance, carrying a spare battery can keep the action rolling.【4†source】

### Ease of Use

The interface is straightforward, and the touchscreen makes navigation a breeze. The quick capture mode is a lifesaver for those moments when you need to start recording instantly.

## Funny Moments

### The Accidental Footage

Have you ever left your camera recording by accident? With the GoPro Hero4 Silver’s durable battery, you might end up with hours of amusing "accidental footage." You know, like your feet or ceiling fan – great for editing bloopers.

### Touchscreen Woes

The touchscreen is amazing, but can be a bit *too* sensitive. A light brush can change settings or playback your footage. It’s like the Hero4 Silver is saying, “Hey, I’m still here!”【4†source】

## Comparison with Modern Action Cameras

### [GoPro Hero 10 Black]({%- post_url 2023-07-04-prime-day-bike-gadgets-accesories -%})
The Hero 10 Black offers advanced stabilization, 5.3K video, and 23MP photos. If you’re looking for cutting-edge tech, this is the way to go. However, it comes with a heftier price tag.

### [DJI Osmo Action]({%- post_url 2023-07-04-prime-day-bike-gadgets-accesories -%})
Another great option is the DJI Osmo Action, it offers a front-facing screen and 4K video. It’s perfect for vloggers and those who need flawless 4K footage.

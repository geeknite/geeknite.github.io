## The Historical Context

Let's take a moment to appreciate the historical setting of *All Bridges Burning*. The Finnish Civil War was a brutal and complex conflict that took place in 1918 between the Reds (socialists) and the Whites (conservatives).

The game does an excellent job of capturing the essence of this tumultuous period, making it not just a game but a learning experience.

## Game Mechanics

### COIN System

If you're familiar with other COIN games by GMT, you'll feel right at home here.

In *All Bridges Burning*, you have three factions: Reds, Whites, and Moderates, each with their own unique objectives and strategies. It's like a three-headed hydra, where every head wants to eat the other two!

### Faction Overview

#### Reds

The Reds aim to control urban areas and mobilize the working class. Think of them as the party planners who are really, really into red decor.

#### Whites

The Whites are all about military control and quelling the socialist uprising. They're like the strict parents who just want everyone to stop partying and go to bed.

#### Moderates

The Moderates seek a balanced approach, focusing on political influence and maintaining order. They're like the friends who always try to mediate between you and your annoying sibling.

## Gameplay Experience

### Action Selection

Each faction has its own set of actions they can perform during their turn. From mobilizing troops to influencing political outcomes, the choices are endless. Just remember, every action has a consequence, and the ripple effects can make or break your strategy.

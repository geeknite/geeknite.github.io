## The Film

### Plot Summary

Utopia takes us on a journey through a dystopian future where society grapples with profound philosophical and ethical dilemmas. The story revolves around protagonist Alex Dumont as he navigates a world on the brink of collapse, searching for hope and meaning amidst chaos.

### Themes and Messages

Utopia is a film that doesn't shy away from heavy themes. It delves into topics like technological dependence, environmental degradation, and the quest for a better society. It's like *Black Mirror* but with a touch of French existentialism. Prepare yourself for some deep, introspective moments.

**Funny Moment**: Remember that scene where Alex tries to explain recycling to a robot, only to end up in a convoluted debate about the ethics of AI? Classic!

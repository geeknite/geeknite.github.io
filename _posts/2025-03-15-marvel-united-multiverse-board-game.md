## Introduction

Welcome to the most epic board game review in the multiverse! Marvel United: Multiverse has landed, and we're here to dissect it with the precision of Doctor Strange casting a spell. Whether you're a die-hard Marvel fan or just love cooperative games, this is the review for you.

## What's in the Box?

Inside this beautifully designed box, you'll find:

- **Miniatures**: High-quality, detailed miniatures of your favorite Marvel heroes and villains.
- **Cards**: Each hero has a deck of cards representing their abilities, actions, and special powers.
- **Game Board**: Various locations from the Marvel universe where battles and missions take place.
- **Tokens and Markers**: Used to track progress, health, and various effects during the game.

**Pro Tip**: Don't let your cat near the miniatures. Those claws are the real supervillains.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up Marvel United: Multiverse is like staging an Avengers movie. It requires careful planning and maybe a snack break (or two). Lay out the game board, distribute cards and miniatures, and choose your villain. Now you're ready to begin your quest.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players draw cards and take actions based on their hero's abilities. You can move, attack, rescue civilians, and more. Cooperation is key, so strategize with your teammates to make the most of your abilities.

### Combat

Combat in Marvel United: Multiverse is a blend of strategy and luck. Each villain has unique mechanics that add challenges and twists to the game. Did you plan an epic combo just to have the villain escape? Welcome to the multiverse, where plans often go awry.

One of the best parts of Marvel United: Multiverse is the diverse array of heroes and villains. From Iron Man to Spider-Gwen, you can play as your favorite characters and face off against legendary foes like Thanos and Kang the Conqueror.

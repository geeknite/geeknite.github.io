## Components: A Collector's Dream

### What's in the Box:
- **Miniatures**: Beautifully crafted miniatures of your favorite Marvel characters, from the intricate details on Doctor Strange's cloak to the menacing grin on Thanos's face
- **Hero Cards**: Each hero has a unique deck representing their abilities, actions, and special powers
- **Villain Cards**: Detailed villain decks with unique mechanics
- **Game Board**: Multiple location tiles from the Marvel universe
- **Tokens and Markers**: Used to track progress, health, threats, and various effects
- **Mission Cards**: Scenario-specific objectives

## Gameplay: How It Works

### Setting Up

Setting up Marvel United: Multiverse is like staging an Avengers movie. Lay out the location tiles, assemble the miniatures, choose your villain, and distribute hero decks. It takes about 5-10 minutes once you're familiar with the process.

### Turn Structure

Each player's turn consists of three simple phases:

1. **Play a Card**: Choose a card from your hand and play it to the timeline
2. **Resolve Actions**: Perform the actions shown on your card AND the previous card
3. **Villain Turn**: After all heroes have acted, the villain activates

This chaining mechanic is brilliant â€” your actions combine with the previous player's, creating combo opportunities and requiring coordination.

### Combat and Objectives

Combat is streamlined and strategic:
- **Attack Villains**: Use attack symbols to damage the main villain or defeat henchmen
- **Complete Missions**: Fulfill specific objectives at various locations
- **Rescue Civilians**: Save innocent bystanders from villain threats
- **Remove Threats**: Clear threat tokens before they overwhelm the heroes

**Win Condition (Verified):** Defeat the villain by reducing their health to zero while completing the required number of missions. If the villain's master plan completes or heroes are overwhelmed, you lose.

## Characters and Scenarios

### Heroes Available

**Verified Hero List includes:**

### Key Strategic Elements:

1. **Card Synergy**: Plan your card plays to combo with teammates
2. **Action Economy**: Maximize actions by chaining effects efficiently
3. **Threat Management**: Balance between attacking the villain and clearing threats
4. **Mission Timing**: Complete missions strategically to maintain momentum

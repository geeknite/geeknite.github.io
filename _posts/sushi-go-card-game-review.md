## The Basics of Sushi Go!

### What is Sushi Go?

Sushi Go! is a fast-paced card game for 2-5 players, where the goal is to create the best combination of sushi dishes. Players draft cards to build their sushi platters, scoring points based on the types and combinations of sushi they collect. It's like a conveyor belt of sushi, but without the food coma!

### Components

The game comes with 108 beautifully illustrated cards, featuring a variety of sushi dishes such as nigiri, sashimi, maki rolls, and more. The artwork is adorable and adds to the overall charm of the game.

**Fun Fact**: The game's creator, Phil Walker-Harding, is known for designing games that are easy to learn yet offer strategic depth. Sushi Go! is no exception, providing a perfect balance of simplicity and strategy.

## Gameplay

### Setting Up

Setting up Sushi Go! is a breeze. Each player starts with a hand of cards, and the game is played over three rounds. Players draft cards from their hands, trying to create the best sushi combinations to score points.

### Drafting and Scoring

The drafting mechanic is at the heart of Sushi Go! Players choose one card from their hand and pass the rest to the next player. This continues until all cards are drafted. The real fun comes from trying to anticipate your opponents' moves and blocking their strategies while maximizing your own score.

Points are scored based on the types of sushi collected. For example, collecting nigiri cards scores points directly, while maki rolls and sashimi require specific combinations to score. There are also special cards like wasabi, which can triple the value of nigiri, and pudding, which scores points at the end of the game.

**Pro Tip**: Keep an eye on the pudding cards! They might seem insignificant during the game, but they can make a big difference in the final score.

## The Strategy

### Anticipating Opponents

One of the key strategies in Sushi Go! is anticipating your opponents' moves. Since everyone drafts cards simultaneously, you need to think ahead and predict which cards your opponents might take. This adds a layer of strategy that keeps the game exciting and engaging.

### Balancing Your Hand

Balancing your hand is crucial. You want to collect high-scoring sushi combinations while preventing your opponents from doing the same. Sometimes, it's worth taking a lower-scoring card if it means blocking an opponent's strategy.

### Special Cards

Using special cards like wasabi and chopsticks can give you an edge. Wasabi triples the value of your nigiri, while chopsticks allow you to draft two cards in one turn. Timing the use of these cards can be the key to victory.

**Funny Moment**: During one game, a player kept drafting pudding cards, thinking they were worthless. Imagine their surprise when they won the game thanks to their stockpile of pudding at the end!

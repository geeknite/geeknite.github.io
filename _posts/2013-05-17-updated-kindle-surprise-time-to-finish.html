**Attention, bookworms and tech enthusiasts!** Amazon has done it again with a Kindle Touch update that introduces a feature so simple yet so revolutionary, it might just change the way you read forever. Curious? Keep reading to find out why this update is a game-changer and why you should update your Kindle right now! ðŸ“–âœ¨

## **The Feature That Blew My Mind: ETA to Finish**

A few days ago, I decided to check if a book I wanted was available on Amazon. Instead of powering up my PC or tablet, I connected the WiFi on my Kindle Touch. To my surprise, a new document appeared announcing an update. And within that document, one feature stood out: **ETA to complete the chapter or the e-book**.

This feature is a game-changer. Imagine knowing exactly how much time you need to finish a chapter or the entire book. Itâ€™s motivational, practical, and, letâ€™s be honest, a little addictive. Whether youâ€™re squeezing in a quick read before bed or planning your weekend reading marathon, this feature has you covered.

## **Why This Feature is a Big Deal**

Letâ€™s face it: time is money, and knowing how much time youâ€™re investing in a book is invaluable. This feature isnâ€™t just about convenience; itâ€™s about optimizing your reading experience. Hereâ€™s why itâ€™s a big deal:

1. **Motivation**: Seeing that you only have 5 minutes left in a chapter can push you to finish it, even if youâ€™re tired.
2. **Planning**: Perfect for those who like to schedule their reading time.
3. **Satisfaction**: Thereâ€™s something incredibly rewarding about seeing your progress in real-time.

## **Criticism: Not All That Glitters is Gold**

While the ETA feature is fantastic, itâ€™s not without its flaws. Here are a few things that could be improved:

- **Accuracy**: The time estimation can sometimes be off, especially if youâ€™re a fast or slow reader. Itâ€™s like your Kindle is trying to guess your reading speed but occasionally gets it hilariously wrong.
- **Limited Scope**: This feature is only available on updated Kindles. If youâ€™re using an older model, youâ€™re out of luck.

## **My Updated Kindle: A New Reading Experience**

After installing the update, I couldnâ€™t wait to test it out. The interface is slicker and more modern, and the ETA feature works seamlessly. Hereâ€™s a snapshot of my Kindle with its trusty folio cover, displaying my progress on *American Gods*:

If youâ€™re a fan of Neil Gaiman, youâ€™ll understand why Iâ€™m hooked. (No spoilers in the comments, please!)

## **Why You Should Update Your Kindle Now**

If you own a Kindle Touch or a more modern back-lit Kindle, **you need this update**. Itâ€™s not just about the ETA feature; the overall interface improvements make the reading experience smoother and more enjoyable.

Thinking about such a feature, really, it should be applied to more scopes. **Time is money, so we should know beforehand where we are investing our time.**

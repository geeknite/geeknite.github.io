Welcome, fellow gamers! Today we're going to dive into the world of **Custom Heroes**, a card game that lets you create your own heroes and battle them in epic showdowns. If you love strategy, customization, and a bit of chaos, this game is for you.

## What is Custom Heroes?

Custom Heroes is a card game where players take on the roles of creators, designing their own heroes with unique abilities and stats. The game is filled with hilarious moments, cool mechanics, and enough drama to make Shakespeare himself jealous.

### The Basics

In Custom Heroes, players start with a set of base cards and use transparent overlays to modify their heroes. Each hero's abilities and stats can be changed, making each game unique and unpredictable. The goal is to battle other heroes, complete missions, and become the ultimate hero creator.

### Components

The game comes with:
- **Base Cards**: The foundation of your heroes, including stats and basic abilities.
- **Overlay Cards**: Transparent cards that modify your heroes' abilities and stats.
- **Mission Cards**: Objectives and challenges to complete for extra points.
- **Tokens and Markers**: Track progress, health, and special effects during the game.

**Pro Tip**: Keep your overlays organized, or you'll end up with a hero that's half invisible and half invincible!

## How to Play

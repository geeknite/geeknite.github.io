## Introduction

Hello Geeknite readers! Today, we're doing something a bit different. We're diving into the time machine to take a look at the **Intel Core i3-4150**. This processor was launched back in 2014, but is it still relevant in 2025? Should you consider it for your next build, or is it better off in the museum next to the floppy disks? Let's find out!

## Specifications

Let's kick things off with the specs:

- **Architecture**: Haswell
- **Cores/Threads**: 2/4
- **Base Clock**: 3.5 GHz
- **TDP**: 54W
- **L3 Cache**: 3MB
- **Memory Support**: DDR3-1600
- **PCIe Version**: 3.0

Looking at these specs, you might think, "What is this, a potato?" But let's dig deeper.

## Performance

### Gaming Performance

Ah, gaming on the i3-4150. This CPU can handle older titles like *CS:GO* and *League of Legends* with decent frame rates. But if you try running *Cyberpunk 2077* or *Call of Duty: Warzone*, you'll be greeted with a slideshow that would make PowerPoint jealous. For modern gaming, you'd be better off using this CPU as a paperweight.

### Productivity Performance

For basic productivity tasks like web browsing, video streaming, and office applications, the i3-4150 can still hold its own. It's not going to set any speed records, but it'll get the job done. Video editing and rendering? Forget about it. The i3-4150 will be huffing and puffing like a marathon runner in a pie-eating contest.

## Thermals and Power Consumption

One of the redeeming qualities of the i3-4150 is its efficiency. With a TDP of just 54W, it stays cool even under load. In our tests, the CPU rarely exceeded 60°C, making it suitable for compact builds where thermal management can be a concern.

## Price and Value

You can find the i3-4150 for dirt cheap these days, often under $20 if you look in the right places like [eBay]({{ site.constants.wsib }}intel-core-i3-4150). But is it worth it? If you're building a retro gaming rig or need a placeholder CPU for a budget build, it might be. However, for modern applications, investing in a more current CPU would be wiser.

## The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly

### The Good

- **Efficiency**: Low TDP and decent thermals.
- **Cheap**: Can be found for next to nothing.
- **Basic Tasks**: Handles everyday tasks reasonably well.

### The Bad

- **Performance**: Struggles with modern games and demanding applications.

### The Ugly

- **Age**: It's ancient in tech years, comparable to using an abacus for calculus.

## Conclusion

The Intel Core i3-4150 is a relic from a bygone era of computing. While it can still handle basic tasks and older games, it falls short in modern applications. If you're a budget builder or a retro enthusiast, it might be worth considering. For everyone else, it's time to move on to greener pastures.

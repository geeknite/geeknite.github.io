## Overview

The Star Trek Adventures Dice Set: Operations Gold is designed for use with the Star Trek Adventures RPG, but can be adapted for other role-playing games. The set includes 2d20 and 4d6, each adorned with Starfleet insignia and other thematic elements.

### Cons

- **Pricey**: Compared to standard dice sets, the Star Trek Adventures Dice Set comes with a higher price tag, which might deter budget-conscious gamers.

Rolling these dice feels like commanding the USS Enterprise itself. The weight and balance are excellent, providing a satisfying tactile experience. The engraved details are crisp, ensuring that the dice remain readable even after extensive use.

In the spirit of scientific exploration, we subjected these dice to rigorous testing. They endured drops, tumbles, and even a simulated photon torpedo attack (okay, maybe not that last one). The result? Not a scratch. These dice are tougher than a Klingon warrior.

## Comparison with Other Thematic Dice Sets

While the Star Wars RPG Dice Set offers thematic elements from a galaxy far, far away, the Star Trek Adventures Dice Set: Operations Gold stands out with its vibrant gold coloring and detailed Starfleet insignia. Both sets provide excellent durability, but the Star Trek dice offer a unique aesthetic that is hard to beat.

### [Marvel United Dice Set]({%- post_url 2023-08-15-marvel-united-multiverse-review -%})

The Marvel United Dice Set brings superhero flair to your tabletop. However, for Trekkies, the Star Trek Adventures Dice Set offers a more immersive experience that perfectly complements the Star Trek Adventures RPG. It's all about where your fandom allegiance lies.

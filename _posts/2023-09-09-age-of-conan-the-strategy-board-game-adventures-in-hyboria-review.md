## What is Age of Conan: The Strategy Board Game?

**Age of Conan: The Strategy Board Game - Adventures in Hyboria** is a board game that takes players on a journey through the world of Hyboria, the setting of Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian stories. Players take on the roles of different factions vying for control over Hyboria, using armies, heroes, and sorcery to achieve their goals.

### Components

The game comes with:
- **Miniatures**: Intricately designed miniatures that represent armies, heroes, and Conan himself. Prepare to be impressed by the detail!
- **Cards**: A deck of cards that provides various actions, events, and abilities.
- **Game Board**: A beautifully illustrated map of Hyboria, divided into regions for strategic conquest.
- **Tokens and Markers**: Used to track progress, resources, and the occasional curse.

**Pro Tip**: Keep your miniatures away from your cat. Cats are convinced they're the true rulers of Hyboria and will attack your armies without mercy.

## Gameplay

### Setting Up

Setting up Age of Conan is like preparing for battle. Lay out the game board, distribute miniatures and cards, and choose your faction. Make sure to have snacks and maybe a war cry ready.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players draw cards and perform actions such as moving armies, engaging in battles, recruiting heroes, and using sorcery. Cooperation is minimal—you're here to conquer, not make friends.

### Combat

Combat in Age of Conan is a blend of strategy and luck. Players use dice and cards to resolve battles, with Conan himself roaming the board and occasionally joining the fray. Did you plan an epic siege only to have Conan show up and throw a wrench in your plans? Welcome to Hyboria.

## The Adventures

### Scenarios

Adventures in Hyboria introduces new scenarios inspired by Conan's legendary tales. From defeating ancient monsters to claiming treasure, each scenario offers unique challenges and requires different strategies.

## The Basics

### What is Keyforge?

Keyforge, designed by Richard Garfield, is a unique deck game where each deck is distinct and cannot be altered. Players compete as archons, using their decks to gain Æmber and forge keys. The first player to forge three keys wins the game. With the **Visions Prophétiques** expansion, the game introduces new mechanics, cards, and strategies, enhancing the already rich gameplay experience.

### Components

The **Visions Prophétiques** expansion includes new decks, each with unique cards and abilities. The artwork is mesmerizing, making you feel like you've stepped into a mystical realm. The expansion also comes with new tokens and markers to keep track of the game's progress.

**Pro Tip**: Don't let your cat near the cards. Those claws are the real supervillains.

## The Gameplay

### Setting Up

Setting up **Visions Prophétiques** is like preparing for a magical ritual. Lay out your decks, shuffle your cards, and get ready to dive into the mystical world of Keyforge. Don't forget to grab some snacks and maybe a crystal ball for added effect.

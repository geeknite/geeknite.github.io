Hello, Geeknite readers! Today, we're taking a nostalgic trip back to 2014 to review the legendary **Intel Core i5-4690K**. It's 2025, and this overclocking beast refuses to retire gracefully. So, is the i5-4690K still worth considering for your next gaming or productivity rig, or should it be left in the tech museum? Let's find out!

## **Introduction**

The Intel Core i5-4690K was once the darling of mid-range CPUs, especially for those who loved to tinker and overclock. Boasting four cores and a base clock of 3.5 GHz, this processor promised to deliver solid performance without costing an arm and a leg. But how does it stack up today, amidst the newer and flashier options?

## **Specifications**

Let's kick things off with the specs:

- **Architecture**: Haswell
- **Cores/Threads**: 4/4
- **Base Clock**: 3.5 GHz
- **Boost Clock**: 3.9 GHz
- **TDP**: 88W
- **L3 Cache**: 6MB
- **Memory Support**: DDR3-1600
- **PCIe Version**: 3.0

Back in the day, these specs were hot stuff. But numbers only tell part of the story. Let's see how it performs in real-world scenarios.

## **Performance**

### **Gaming Performance**

In gaming benchmarks, the i5-4690K holds its own surprisingly well against some newer budget CPUs. Titles like *Counter-Strike: Global Offensive* and *League of Legends* run smoothly, with frame rates hitting acceptable levels for 1080p gaming. However, if you try to run *Cyberpunk 2077* on ultra settings, well, let's just say Johnny Silverhand might take a break from your screen.

### **Productivity Performance**

For productivity tasks, the i5-4690K can still handle basic video editing and lightweight 3D rendering. However, don't expect it to blaze through tasks like a modern Ryzen or Intel Core i9. It's more like the reliable old dog that gets the job done slowly but surely.

## **Thermals and Power Consumption**

One of the known features of the i5-4690K is its tendency to run warm, especially when overclocked. With a TDP of 88W, it needs decent cooling to prevent it from turning into a mini heater. In our stress tests, the CPU occasionally hit 80°C with an aftermarket cooler. This makes it a less ideal choice for compact builds.

## **Price and Value**

In 2025, you can find the i5-4690K for around $50-70 on the used market. It's a great deal if you're looking to build a retro gaming PC or need a budget-friendly processor for a lightweight setup.

## **The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly**

### **The Good**

- **Decent Gaming Performance**: Handles older and less demanding games well.
- **Overclockability**: Easy to squeeze more performance out of it.
- **Affordable**: Great value for retro builds.

### **The Bad**

- **Limited Modern Performance**: Struggles with newer, demanding tasks.
- **DDR3 Memory**: Limited to older DDR3 RAM.

### **The Ugly**

- **Thermals**: Runs hot, requires good cooling.
- **Single-thread Performance**: Lags behind modern CPUs.

## **Conclusion**

The Intel Core i5-4690K is a blast from the past that can still offer decent performance for budget builds and retro gaming. If you're a fan of overclocking and want to experiment with older hardware, it's definitely worth considering. However, for modern gaming and productivity tasks, you're better off with a newer CPU.

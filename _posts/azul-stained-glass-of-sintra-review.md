## What is Azul: Stained Glass of Sintra?

**Azul: Stained Glass of Sintra** is a tile-drafting game designed by Michael Kiesling and published by Next Move Games. This sequel to the award-winning Azul takes players into the world of stained glass artistry, where each player aims to create the most beautiful and valuable window panes. The game is designed for 2-4 players and takes about 30-45 minutes to play, making it a perfect choice for both casual and serious gamers.

### Components and Quality

The game comes with stunning components, including translucent glass pieces that make you feel like a real artisan. The player boards are double-sided, adding variety to each playthrough. The quality of the components is top-notch, with beautiful illustrations and well-crafted pieces that enhance the overall experience.

**Fun Fact**: The glass pieces are so mesmerizing that you might find yourself staring at them instead of playing the game. Don't worry, we won't judge!

### Gameplay

## The Basics

### What is Among Cultists: Down Into The Abyss?

Among Cultists: Down Into The Abyss is a cooperative and competitive board game where players take on the roles of cultists and investigators. The goal for the cultists is to complete dark rituals without getting caught, while the investigators must uncover and stop them before it's too late. It's a game of deception, strategy, and a little bit of luck.

### Components

The game comes with a beautifully illustrated game board, detailed miniatures for cultists and investigators, a plethora of cards representing rituals, items, and events, and various tokens to track progress and influence. The artwork and components are top-notch, immersing players in the eerie atmosphere of the game.

**Pro Tip**: Don't play this game in a dimly lit basement unless you enjoy the extra creepy factor. Or do. I won't judge.

## Gameplay

### Setting Up

Setting up Among Cultists is like preparing for a séance. Lay out the game board, distribute character roles and miniatures, and shuffle the decks of cards. Each player receives their secret role, and the game begins with a sense of mystery and anticipation.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players perform actions such as moving, investigating, performing rituals, or using special abilities. Cultists must be sneaky, while investigators need to be observant and strategic. The interactions between players create a tense atmosphere, as every move can tip the balance.

### Stealth and Strategy

The game heavily relies on stealth and strategy. Cultists work together to complete their rituals without raising suspicion, using deception and misdirection. Investigators, on the other hand, must deduce who the cultists are and thwart their plans. It's a delicate dance of trust and betrayal.

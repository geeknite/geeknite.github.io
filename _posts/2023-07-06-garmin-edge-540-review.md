If you're a cyclist who loves to explore new routes, track your performance, and never run out of battery, you might want to check out [the new Garmin Edge 540]({{ site.constants[0].wsib }}/garmin edge 540). This bike computer is the latest and greatest from Garmin, and it comes in two versions: normal and solar. In this blog post, I'll tell you everything you need to know about the Edge 540, how it compares to other bike computers, and why you should (or shouldn't) buy it.

## What is the Garmin Edge 540?

The Garmin Edge 540 is a GPS-enabled bike computer that lets you navigate, monitor your speed, distance, cadence, heart rate, power, and more. It also connects to your smartphone via Bluetooth or ANT+, so you can receive notifications, upload your rides to Garmin Connect or Strava, and access live weather and traffic information. The Edge 540 has a 2.6-inch color touchscreen that is easy to read in any light condition, and it can be mounted on your handlebar or stem with the included quarter-turn mount.

The Edge 540 has some impressive features that make it stand out from other bike computers. For example:

- It has a battery life of up to 20 hours in GPS mode, and up to 40 hours with the optional battery pack.
- It has a built-in incident detection feature that automatically sends your location to your emergency contacts if you crash.
- It has a ClimbPro feature that shows you the remaining ascent and grade of each climb on your route.
- It has a Trailforks app that lets you access maps and trail information for over 80,000 trails worldwide.
- It has a GroupTrack feature that lets you see where your riding buddies are on the map.

But wait, there's more! The Edge 540 also comes in a solar version, which has a transparent solar panel on the top of the device that can extend the battery life by up to 10%. That means you can ride for up to 22 hours in GPS mode, or up to 44 hours with the battery pack. The solar panel also works indoors, as long as there is some ambient light. How cool is that?

## How does the Garmin Edge 540 compare to other bike computers?

The Garmin Edge 540 is not the only bike computer on the market. There are other options that might suit your needs better, depending on your budget and preferences. Here are some of the main alternatives:

For those who haven't been introduced to the world of [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&linkCode=ur2&linkId=E3JCOPRWJFHIP2PV&tag={{ site.constants.amazon_com }}&linkId=Z6HW7WG5Z73QGVTE){: rel="nofollow"}, it's basically the internet's giant shopping cart, originally from the US but with a local branch in Spain that's been around for a few years now. Known for its vast selection of books, Amazon now sells just about anything you can think of, often at prices that will make your wallet weep with joy. After years of online shopping, Amazon Spain has become my go-to store, offering top-notch customer service that has never let me down.

Here's a list of tips, sprinkled with humor, based on my shopping adventures on Amazon Spain over the years:

1. **The obvious choice for shopping from Spain is** [amazon.es](https://www.amazon.es/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=3626&creative=24822&linkCode=ur2&tag={{ site.constants.amazon_es }}){: rel="nofollow"} or its fashion outlet [BuyVip](https://www.amazon.es/b?ie=UTF8&node=13713654031&tag={{ site.constants.amazon_es }}){: rel="nofollow"}. They might not have as many sections or products as [amazon.co.uk](https://www.amazon.co.uk/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&linkCode=ur2&tag={{ site.constants.amazon_uk }}){: rel="nofollow"} or [amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&linkCode=ur2&tag={{ site.constants.amazon_com }}&linkId=E3JCOPRWJFHIP2PV){: rel="nofollow"}, but for electronics, gadgets, books, and clothes, it's a solid option. ~~Free shipping used to kick in at 19€ for books or clothes, otherwise, it was 2.99€ for the cheapest option~~. But now, in a thrilling twist, **free shipping is yours if you spend over 29€** unless you want it in one day, in which case you'll need to [become a Prime member](https://www.amazon.es/gp/prime/pipeline/landing/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0&linkCode=ll2&tag={{ site.constants.amazon_es }}&linkId=3d1d9f5bc192c963b2abefbca0dadbba){: rel="nofollow"}.

2. **Compare prices across Amazons**: A great tool for quickly comparing prices across different Amazons is [Smartshopping #PYB]({{ site.constants.wsib }}?c=es), which saves time and also compares prices with [Ebay](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/1185-53479-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=1&pub=5575077854&toolid=10001&campid=5337456056&customid=&ipn=psmain&icep_vectorid=229501&kwid=902099&mtid=824&kw=lg){: rel="nofollow"}. It'll recommend the best online stores for your product and offer interesting alternatives. You could also try using other regional Amazons like [amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/) or [amazon.fr](https://www.amazon.fr/) to find better deals.

3. **Beware of customs fees**: If you're shopping on [amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&linkCode=ur2&tag={{ site.constants.amazon_com }}&linkId=E3JCOPRWJFHIP2PV), your package will come from the USA and customs could be an issue. Although Amazon includes an extra fee for customs, the total cost can significantly increase, making European Amazons a preferable option.

4. **Choose Amazon-handled shipping**: Try to buy products sold by Amazon itself; third-party products are fine as long as Amazon handles the shipping, allowing you to combine shipping costs for different items. If buying from third parties, you'll likely face separate shipping fees for each product.

5. **Shop local when possible**: It's generally better to buy third-party products from your home country, in our case, [amazon.es](https://www.amazon.es/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=3626&creative=24822&linkCode=ur2&tag={{ site.constants.amazon_es }}){: rel="nofollow"}, to avoid future issues. Stick to single-product purchases and scrutinize the shipping fees.

6. **Look out for exclusive offers**: Often there are exclusive offers for Spanish shoppers that are not available on other Amazon sites. Keep an eye on the deals section for these bargains.

7. **Check product reviews wisely**: While reviews can be helpful, beware of suspiciously positive feedback. Look for detailed reviews with photos and verified purchase badges to filter out the unreliable ones.

8. **Utilize Prime benefits**: If you shop frequently, Amazon Prime is a great option. Besides quick shipping, you get access to Prime Video, Prime Music, and more. Just ensure it’s worth the annual fee by evaluating your shopping habits.

9. **Leverage Amazon's customer service**: Amazon's customer service in Spain is top-notch. Don't hesitate to contact them for issues with orders, returns, or refunds. They often respond quickly and are very accommodating.

10. **Plan purchases ahead of time**: For seasonal shopping or big-ticket items, watch for Amazon's sales events like Prime Day and Black Friday. You can save significantly by planning and purchasing during these sales.

Happy shopping, and may your carts be ever in your favor!

### What is "Among Cultists: Down Into The Abyss"?

Among Cultists: Down Into The Abyss is a cooperative board game with a twist. Players must work together to complete objectives while identifying and dealing with hidden cultists in their midst. Think of it like a horror version of "Among Us" but with more sinister laughs and fewer spaceship malfunctions.

### Components

## Gameplay

### Setting Up

Setting up Among Cultists: Down Into The Abyss feels like preparing for a séance gone wrong. Lay out the game board, distribute character miniatures, and shuffle the decks. Make sure to dim the lights for the full creepy effect.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players draw cards and take actions based on their character's abilities. The objective is to complete tasks without getting sabotaged by the hidden cultists. Easier said than done when your best friend might just be a cultist in disguise.

### Identifying Cultists

The game has a social deduction element where players must use their wits to identify who the cultists are.

## The Basics

Eclipse Phase is a role-playing game set in a dystopian future where humanity is fighting for survival against rogue AI, bio-engineered horrors, and its own worst tendencies. The GM screen is designed to be a handy reference tool for the Game Master, providing quick access to rules, tables, and plots that help keep the game flowing smoothly.

But let's be honest, it's also there as a barrier to hide the GM's tears and frantic dice-rolling from the players. Let's see if this screen is up to the task!

## What's in the Box?

The Eclipse Phase GM screen is a sturdy, four-panel screen featuring stunning artwork on the player-facing side that captures the eerie and unsettling vibe of the game. The GM-facing side is loaded with tables, rules, and information meant to streamline gameplay. Here's a breakdown:

### Player-Facing Artwork

The artwork is nothing short of breathtaking (and mildly terrifying). The screen features scenes of cybernetic monstrosities, desolate landscapes, and the occasional existential nightmare. Players will love it, if by "love" you mean "stare at it and contemplate their existence."

### GM-Facing Information

The GM side is a treasure trove of useful data, including:

- Initiative and combat tables
- Hacking and psi attack procedures
- Stat blocks for common NPCs and enemies
- Plot hooks and quick-reference rules

**Pro Tip:** The screen also includes a handy table for generating random existential crises in your players. Perfect for those moments when they start to feel a bit too secure.

## Usability

One of the biggest challenges for any GM screen is usability. How easy is it to find the information you need when you need it? Fortunately, Eclipse Phase delivers on this front. The layout is intuitive, and the font size is large enough to read without squinting.

**Funny Moment:** During one session, I desperately needed the psi attack rules. As I fumbled through the screen, my players joked that I was trying to hack into the game's source code. Ah, the joys of role-playing!

## Durability

This screen is built to last. The panels are made of high-quality cardboard, and the folding hinges are robust. It's clear that the designers knew GMs would be slamming their fists on this thing in rage and despair, and they made sure it could take a beating.

**Criticism Alert:** My only gripe is that the screen is a bit too tall. I had to peer over it like a short person at a concert. But hey, maybe that's just me.

## Extra Features

### Quick Reference Sheets

Along with the screen, you get a set of laminated quick reference sheets. They're perfect for handing out to newbie players, or for referencing when you're too lazy to flip through the rulebook.

### Custom Dice

The screen comes with a set of custom Eclipse Phase dice. They roll well, they look cool, and they might even be lucky. Or maybe that's just the GM's wishful thinking.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- **Beautiful Artwork:** The player-facing side is a visual treat.
- **Comprehensive Information:** Everything a GM needs is right there.
- **Sturdy Construction:** Built to withstand the emotional turmoil of GMing.
- **Bonus Items:** Quick reference sheets and custom dice are a nice touch.

### Cons

- **Height Issue:** Might be a bit tall for some GMs.
- **Information Overload:** There's a lot crammed on the GM side; can be overwhelming.

## Final Thoughts

The Eclipse Phase GM screen is a fantastic addition to any GM's toolkit. It offers a blend of stunning artwork and practical information, ensuring that your game sessions run smoothly (or as smoothly as they can in a world filled with existential dread). Whether you're a veteran GM or just starting out, this screen will make your life easier—and might even save you from a few headaches.

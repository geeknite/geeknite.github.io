## Introduction

Greetings, fellow survivors and brain-munching enthusiasts! Today, we’re diving into the gritty, zombie-infested world of **Zombicide: Special Guest Edouard Guiton**. If you’re a fan of the Zombicide series, you’re in for a treat—or should I say, a brainy feast?

## What’s in the Box?

Let’s talk about the goodies. This expansion brings a whole new level of artistry and strategy to Zombicide. Here’s what you get:

- **Miniatures**: Beautifully crafted miniatures designed by the legendary Edouard Guiton. These undead fiends are so detailed, you’ll want to set them on your mantle (after a thorough cleaning, of course).
- **New Survivors**: Fresh faces (and decomposing ones) join the fray, each with unique abilities to help you survive the apocalypse.
- **Gear and Equipment**: Because who doesn’t want a chainsaw that doubles as a back-scratcher?

**Pro Tip**: Try not to get too attached to your survivors. In this game, the life expectancy of a character is slightly less than that of a snowman in July.

## Gameplay Enhancements

### The Survivors

Edouard Guiton’s characters aren’t just pretty faces (though they are quite the lookers, even with half their flesh missing). Each new survivor brings unique abilities to the table, shaking up your strategies and keeping the game fresh. Whether you’re a newbie or a hardened Zombicide veteran, these characters add intriguing new dynamics.

### New Abilities

One of the highlights is the introduction of new abilities tailored to the characters. Fancy slicing zombies like butter? There’s an ability for that. Want to turn everyday objects into deadly weapons? You got it. These abilities not only add depth to your strategy but also provide endless entertainment as you watch your friends try to figure out how to best use them.

### Equipment and Gadgets

The new gear is a game-changer. From explosive devices to high-tech gadgets, you’ll feel like a kid in a (zombie-infested) candy store. Each piece of equipment has been carefully designed to fit seamlessly into the game, offering new tactical options and ways to dispatch the undead hordes.

**Fun Fact**: Did you know that Edouard Guiton is known for his work on the popular game, *Ankama’s Krosmaster*? His unique style and attention to detail shine through in this expansion.

## Visuals and Design

### Miniature Quality

The miniatures are where Edouard Guiton’s artistry truly shines. Each figure is meticulously detailed, bringing the characters and zombies to life (or un-life, as it were). From the tattered clothing to the gruesome wounds, these miniatures are a visual feast for the eyes—though you might not want to look too closely right after lunch.

### Artwork and Aesthetics

Edouard Guiton’s artwork sets a new standard for Zombicide expansions. The vibrant, gritty designs perfectly capture the chaotic, desperate world of the game. Whether it’s the expressive faces of the survivors or the grotesque details of the zombies, every piece of art adds to the immersive experience.

## Introduction

Welcome, board game enthusiasts! Today, we're diving into the world of **The Card Game of the Monopolist**, the 1898 style repro of **The Landlord's Game**. If you think Monopoly is the pinnacle of capitalist board gaming, wait until you see its grandfather. This game promises to be a thrilling combination of strategy, luck, and the occasional bout of rage quitting. Let's get started!

## What is The Card Game of the Monopolist?

The Card Game of the Monopolist is a reproduction of the original 1898 version of The Landlord's Game. Designed by Elizabeth Magie, it was created to highlight the evils of land monopolies and economic inequality. Ironically, it became the blueprint for the much-loved (and hated) Monopoly game we know today.

### Components

The game comes with:
- **Cards**: Beautifully illustrated cards representing properties, utilities, and various game mechanics.
- **Game Board**: A reproduction of the original 1898 board, complete with spaces like "Collect $200" and "Go to Jail".
- **Tokens**: Various tokens representing players, including the infamous top hat and iron.
- **Money**: Paper money that looks suspiciously like something you'd use to play pretend banker.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up The Card Game of the Monopolist is a breeze. Lay out the board, shuffle the cards, distribute money, and choose your token. Now, you're ready to embark on a journey of economic domination.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players draw cards, buy properties, and attempt to bankrupt their opponents. Sounds familiar, right? The twist is in the historical context and the mechanics that emphasize the social message behind the game.

### Winning and Losing

To win, you must bankrupt your opponents and own the majority of properties on the board. If you end up in jail, well, you might as well start practicing your sad puppy face.

## The Humor Factor

One of the best aspects of The Card Game of the Monopolist is the humor built into the gameplay. From the cheeky property names to the ironic "Collect $200" card, you'll find yourself chuckling as much as strategizing.

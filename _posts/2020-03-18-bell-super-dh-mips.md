## Key Features

### MIPS Technology

The Bell Super DH helmet has more acronyms than a tech startup. The big one here is MIPS (Multi-directional Impact Protection System). This fancy-pants technology reduces rotational forces on your head during angled impacts. So, when you inevitably bail trying to impress your friends, your brain will thank you.

### Removable Chin Bar

One moment it's a full-face helmet, the next, it's a half-shell. The removable chin bar on the Bell Super DH MIPS is the Swiss Army knife of helmets. Got a tough downhill section? Chin bar on. Gentle trail ride? Chin bar off. And no, it won't magically turn you into Superman.

### Ventilation

With 19 vents, you can say goodbye to the sauna effect. This helmet has enough airflow to keep your head cool even when you're sweating like a Sumo wrestler in a steam room.

## Performance

### Comfort

The Bell Super DH MIPS fits like a glove—if gloves were designed to hug your head. The padding is plush, and the fit system is so customizable that even your pet hamster might find it comfortable.

### Durability

This helmet is built like a tank. It's made to withstand whatever Mother Nature throws your way—even if she's feeling particularly vengeful.

### Weight

At around 850 grams, it's relatively lightweight for a full-face helmet. Your neck muscles will thank you after a long day on the trails.

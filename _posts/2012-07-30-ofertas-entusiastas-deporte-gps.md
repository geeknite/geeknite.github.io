### Why I Chose the Garmin Edge 500

After weeks of research, forum discussions, and indecision, I finally settled on the **Garmin Edge 500 Bundle** ([check price on Amazon](https://www.amazon.es/gp/product/B002O0QBN4?tag={{ site.constants.amazon_es }})). Why? It's a cycling-specific GPS that includes a cadence sensor and heart rate monitor—all for around €200.

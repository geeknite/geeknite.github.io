## Introduction

## The Basics

### What is Warfighter Modern Shadow War?

Warfighter Modern Shadow War is a cooperative tactical combat game where players take on the roles of elite soldiers completing missions in hostile environments. Expansion 29 introduces a pack of multi-national soldiers, adding diversity and new strategic options to your gameplay.

### Components

Expansion 29 comes with beautifully illustrated cards, detailed miniatures, and a rulebook that's more comprehensive than a manual on how to build a space rocket. The quality of the components is top-notch, adding a layer of immersion that's just as satisfying as successfully landing a silent headshot.

## Gameplay

### Setting Up

Setting up Expansion 29 is like preparing for a UN meeting—lots of characters, lots of flags, and definitely lots of confusion. Each soldier comes with unique abilities and national traits, which you’ll need to consider when forming your team.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players will utilize their soldiers' unique skills to perform actions, such as moving, attacking, and providing support. Communication and coordination are key, especially when your German sniper wants to go all Rambo while your British medic insists on stopping for tea.

### Strategy and Synergy

The game shines in its strategic depth. Managing a multi-national squad means leveraging each soldier's strengths while navigating their quirks. It's like the Olympics, but with more explosions and fewer medals.

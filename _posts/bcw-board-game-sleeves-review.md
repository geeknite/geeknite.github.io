These sleeves are designed to handle frequent shuffling and the occasional tantrum. They are resistant to tearing and bending, making them a reliable choice for protecting your cards.

### Performance

During gameplay, the sleeves perform admirably. They don’t stick together, and the cards shuffle smoothly. Whether you’re dealing, drawing, or discarding, these sleeves ensure your cards remain pristine.

**Funny Moment**: During one particularly intense game of Catan, a friend spilled their drink all over the table. Thanks to the BCW Sleeves, the cards emerged unscathed. The same could not be said for the tablecloth.

## How BCW Sleeves Compare to Other Brands

### [Premium Sleeves]({{ site.constants.wsib }}premium-sleeves)

Premium sleeves offer higher durability and a variety of sizes, but they come at a higher price. If you’re looking for the best protection, premium sleeves are worth the investment.

### [Budget Sleeves]({{ site.constants.wsib }}budget-sleeves)

Budget sleeves are cheaper but may not offer the same level of protection. They’re great for casual gaming, but don’t expect them to withstand intense sessions.

## Introduction

Welcome back, fellow board game enthusiasts! Today, we're diving into the vibrant world of Azul: Jeu de tuiles. If you think laying tiles is just for your bathroom, think again! Azul is the ultimate tile-laying showdown that combines strategy, aesthetics, and the occasional curse word when you realize you've blocked yourself. Grab your popcorn and let's get started!

## What is Azul?

Azul is a strategy board game designed by Michael Kiesling and published by Plan B Games. It's a tile-laying game where players draft tiles from a central market and place them on their personal board to create beautiful patterns. The game is set in the royal palace of Evora, where players compete to decorate the walls with intricate tile designs.

## Game Components

Let's talk about the components, shall we? Azul comes with:

- 100 resin tiles in five gorgeous colors: blue, red, yellow, black, and turquoise.
- 4 player boards: Because playing on the floor is so passé.
- 9 factory displays: Think of these as the tile buffet stations.
- 1 scoring board: To keep track of who's the true tile-laying master.
- 1 starting player marker: The coveted first-player token.
- A linen bag: For that extra touch of class.

The quality of the components is top-notch, and the tiles have a satisfying weight to them. Just try not to eat them—they look like candy!

## How to Play

### Setup

1. Place the factory displays in the center of the table.
2. Fill the bag with all the tiles and draw four tiles for each factory display.
3. Each player takes a board and places it in front of them.
4. Choose a starting player and give them the starting player marker.

### Game Rounds

The game is played over several rounds, each consisting of three phases:

1. **Factory Offer**: Players take turns choosing tiles from the factory displays and placing them on their player boards. Any remaining tiles go to the center display.
2. **Wall-Tiling**: Players move tiles from their pattern lines to their wall, scoring points based on the placement of the tiles.
3. **Preparation**: Refill the factory displays with new tiles and pass the starting player marker to the next player.

### Scoring

Scoring in Azul is both satisfying and maddening. Players score points based on the placement of their tiles, with bonuses for completing rows, columns, and specific color sets. But beware! Any tiles left over in your pattern lines or floor line will cost you points.

## Strategy Tips

1. **Plan Ahead**: Azul is all about planning. Try to anticipate which tiles you'll need in future rounds and avoid taking tiles that will leave you with a lot of leftovers.

2. **Block Your Opponents**: Pay attention to what your opponents are doing and try to deny them the tiles they need. It's not just about making your board look pretty; it's about making theirs look like a dumpster fire.

3. **Balance Your Pattern Lines**: Be careful not to overcommit to a single pattern line. Spread out your tiles to avoid getting stuck with tiles you can't use.

4. **Aim for Bonuses**: Completing rows, columns, and color sets can give you a significant point boost. Plan your moves to maximize these bonuses.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

- **Beautiful Artwork and Components**: The tiles are absolutely stunning and add a tactile joy to the game.
- **Simple Rules, Deep Strategy**: Easy to learn but offers a depth of strategy that keeps you coming back.
- **High Replayability**: Each game feels different due to the random tile draws and varied player strategies.
- **Competitive Yet Friendly**: The game has just enough player interaction to keep things interesting without causing too many family feuds.

### Cons

- **Analysis Paralysis**: Players prone to overthinking may find themselves stuck in decision-making limbo.
- **Tile Shortage Frustration**: Running out of tiles you need can be maddening, especially when it happens repeatedly.
- **Component Storage**: The box insert could be better designed for organizing the tiles and components.

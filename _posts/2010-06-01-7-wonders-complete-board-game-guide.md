## 7 Wonders: Architects - The Family-Friendly Gateway

### Game Overview

**7 Wonders: Architects** represents a **streamlined reimagining** of the original 7 Wonders, designed specifically for **family play and newcomers** while maintaining the franchise's strategic core. Players race to complete their wonder by gathering resources, advancing science, building military strength, and constructing their architectural masterpiece-all through simple card-drawing mechanics.

**Publisher Information (Fact-Checked):**
- **Designer:** Antoine Bauza (original 7 Wonders creator)
- **Publisher:** Repos Production
- **Release Date:** June 2021
- **Availability:** Widely available 2025
- **MSRP:** $39.99-44.99 USD
- **Language Versions:** 25+ languages

### Components and Production Quality

**What's in the Box:**

**Wonder Boards (7 Total):**
- **Pyramids of Giza** (Egypt)
- **Lighthouse of Alexandria** (Egypt)
- **Colossus of Rhodes** (Greece)
- **Hanging Gardens of Babylon** (Mesopotamia)
- **Temple of Artemis at Ephesus** (Greece)
- **Statue of Zeus at Olympia** (Greece)
- **Mausoleum at Halicarnassus** (Greece)

Each wonder board features **3D plastic construction** with stackable pieces that visually represent building progress-a unique tactile element that enhances the building experience.

**Cards (Variable by Wonder):**
- **Resource Cards:** Wood, Stone, Clay, Papyrus (standard resources)
- **Military Cards:** Shields for conflict resolution
- **Science Cards:** Symbols for scientific advancement
- **Gold Cards:** Currency for special actions
- **Wonder Cards:** Specific to each wonder's deck

**Tokens:**
- **Progress Tokens:** Track scientific advancement
- **Military Conflict Tokens:** Victory/defeat in battles
- **Cat Tokens:** Yes, seriously-cats! (Thematic flavor representing ancient Egyptian reverence)

**Production Quality:**
- **3D Wonders:** Unique selling point, durable plastic construction
- **Artwork:** Vibrant, accessible style (different from original 7 Wonders' classical art)
- **Card Quality:** Standard linen-finish cardstock
- **Box Insert:** Functional storage for all components

### Gameplay Mechanics

**Setup (5 Minutes):**

1. Each player selects a wonder and takes corresponding board + 3D pieces
2. Shuffle each wonder's unique card deck and place beside board
3. Place central deck in middle of table
4. Position progress tokens and conflict tokens within reach
5. Ready to play!

**Turn Structure (Simultaneous):**

Unlike the original 7 Wonders' card-drafting, Architects uses **simplified card selection**:

**On Your Turn:**
1. **Choose ONE deck** to draw from:
   - **Left neighbor's deck** (visible top card)
   - **Right neighbor's deck** (visible top card)  
   - **Central deck** (face-down, mystery)
   - **Your wonder deck** (visible top card)

2. **Resolve the card** immediately:
   - **Resources:** Add to your resource pool
   - **Military:** Add shield, potentially trigger conflict
   - **Science:** Advance on progress track, gain bonuses
   - **Gold:** Versatile wild resource
   - **Wonder:** Spend required resources to build next wonder stage

3. **Check for victory:** First to complete all wonder stages wins instantly!

**Military Conflicts:**
- Triggered when players reach specific military thresholds
- Compare total shields with neighbors
- Winner gains conflict token (victory points)
- Loser suffers penalty (loses progress token or similar)
- Non-interactive but creates tension

**Scientific Progress:**
- Three scientific symbols: Gears, Compasses, Tablets
- Collecting sets grants **progress tokens** with powerful one-time abilities
- Examples: "Take any 2 resources," "Build wonder stage for free," "Steal opponent's resource"
- Strategic element: timing when to use progress tokens

**Building Your Wonder:**
- Each stage requires specific resources (varies by wonder)
- Spend accumulated resources to build next stage
- **Example (Pyramids):** Stage 1 = 2 Stone, Stage 2 = 3 Stone + 1 Clay, Stage 3 = 4 Stone + 1 Papyrus + 1 Wood
- Each completed stage grants abilities and brings you closer to victory
- First to complete final stage wins immediately (no simultaneous victory)

### Strategic Depth Analysis

**Despite Simplified Mechanics, Strategy Exists:**

**Deck Selection Tactics:**
- **Neighbor Watching:** What resources do opponents need? Hate-drafting valuable cards
- **Central Deck Gambling:** Risk unknown card for potentially perfect draw
- **Wonder Deck Timing:** When to commit to building vs gathering resources

**Military Pressure:**
- **Aggressive Strategy:** Rush shields early, force conflicts
- **Defensive Strategy:** Maintain parity, avoid penalties
- **Ignoring Military:** Viable if completing wonder quickly (risky!)

**Science Optimization:**
- **Set Collection:** Prioritize completing sets for powerful progress tokens
- **Token Timing:** Use progress tokens at critical moments (stealing key resource, free building)
- **Opponent Disruption:** Progress tokens can hinder opponents directly

**Wonder-Specific Strategies:**
- **Pyramids (Giza):** Stone-heavy, rewards resource gathering
- **Lighthouse (Alexandria):** Gold-focused, flexible resource conversion
- **Colossus (Rhodes):** Military-oriented, aggressive playstyle
- **Each wonder:** Different resource requirements and special abilities

> **Pro Tip:** Keep an eye on your opponents' progress! Nothing is more satisfying than completing your wonder just as your friend is about to finish theirs. Hate-draft their critical resource cards when visible on neighbor decks!

### Replayability and Variability

**What Keeps It Fresh:**
- **7 Different Wonders:** Each plays differently with unique strategies
- **Randomized Card Draws:** No two games identical
- **Player Count Scaling:** 2-7 players all viable
- **Variable Player Skill:** Accessible for mixed-skill groups

**Limitations:**
- **Simpler Than Original:** Less complex decision trees
- **Limited Player Interaction:** Indirect competition (no trading, negotiation)
- **Solved Strategies:** Experienced players may find optimal paths

**Replay Longevity:** 20-30 plays before feeling repetitive for hardcore gamers, indefinite for casual family gaming.

### Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Simple Rules:** Learn in 5 minutes, teach in 10
- ✅ **Quick Playtime:** 25-30 minutes, perfect for weeknight gaming
- ✅ **High-Quality Components:** 3D wonders are visually impressive
- ✅ **Strategic Depth:** Multiple viable paths to victory despite simplicity
- ✅ **Excellent Gateway Game:** Introduces card-drafting concepts accessibly
- ✅ **Family-Friendly:** Appeals to kids (8+) and adults equally
- ✅ **Beautiful Artwork:** Vibrant, inviting aesthetic
- ✅ **Scalable Player Count:** Works well 2-7 players

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Limited Player Interaction:** Mostly indirect competition
- ❌ **Resource Luck Dependency:** Card draw randomness can frustrate planners
- ❌ **Less Complex Than Original:** Veterans may find it too light
- ❌ **Component Storage:** Box insert functional but not optimal
- ❌ **No Expansions (Yet):** Limited content compared to original 7 Wonders ecosystem
- ❌ **Cat Tokens Confusion:** Thematic element lacks mechanical purpose (flavor only)

**Verdict: 8.5/10** - Outstanding family game and excellent gateway to the 7 Wonders universe. Perfect for introducing newcomers, casual gaming sessions, and mixed-age groups. Experienced gamers seeking deep strategy should explore 7 Wonders: Duel or original 7 Wonders instead.

> **Funny Moment:** During one game, a friend was so focused on gathering resources that he didn't notice he had enough to complete his wonder. We all had a good laugh as he frantically tried to finish before realizing he could have won two turns earlier!

2. **God Summoning Priority:**
   - Race for most powerful gods
   - Hate-summon to deny opponent critical deity
   - Combo potential (multiple gods synergizing)

### Funny Moments and Player Stories

**Divine Mishaps:**

> **Oops, Wrong Target:** "In one game, a player summoned Zeus to destroy an opponent's military building, only to realize they had accidentally targeted their own! Zeus may have laughed, but the player did not!"

> **Analysis Paralysis Deity:** "The pantheon adds so many decisions that one friend spent 5 minutes deliberating whether to summon Isis or save tokens for Zeus. By the time he decided, the opponent had won via military victory!"

> **Snake Token Shenanigans:** "Used snake token to move opponent's desired god to unavailable position right before their turn. The look of betrayal was priceless!"

### Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

- ❌ **Potential Balance Issues:** Some gods arguably more powerful (Zeus vs minor deities)

**Verdict: 9/10** - Outstanding expansion that elevates 7 Wonders: Duel from excellent to exceptional. Essential for serious Duel fans, but newcomers should master base game first (5-10 plays) before adding Pantheon complexity.

> **Pro Tip:** Keep the components organized during play. The gods may be patient, but your opponent probably isn't! Use small bowls for tokens and keep the pantheon board clearly visible to both players.

## 7 Wonders: Wonder Pack - Expanding the Ancient World

### Expansion Overview

The **7 Wonders Wonder Pack** adds **four new wonders** to the original 7 Wonders base game, each with unique abilities and strategic approaches. Unlike the Pantheon expansion for Duel, the Wonder Pack integrates with the **original multiplayer 7 Wonders** (3-7 players).

### The Four New Wonders

**1. The Great Wall of China (中国长城)**

**Historical Context (Fact-Checked):**
- **Construction Period:** 7th century BCE - 1644 CE (various dynasties)
- **Total Length:** ~21,196 km (13,171 miles) including all branches
- **Purpose:** Defense against nomadic invasions, border control
- **Status:** Partially ruins, partially restored, UNESCO World Heritage Site
- **Note:** NOT one of ancient Seven Wonders but globally iconic structure

**Game Mechanics:**
- **A Side Ability:** Military-focused, grants shields
- **B Side Ability:** Defensive bonuses, protects from neighbor attacks
- **Strategic Profile:** 
  * Best for military-oriented strategies
  * Rewards defensive play
  * Ideal for players between aggressive military neighbors
- **Resource Requirements:** Variable by stage (typical stone/clay emphasis)
- **Stage Benefits:**
  * Stage 1: Minor military boost
  * Stage 2: Defensive shield against one neighbor
  * Stage 3: Significant military + economic benefit

**Strategic Considerations:**
- **When to Choose:** Military-heavy meta, or seated between military players
- **Synergies:** Red (military) cards, age III military guild cards
- **Weaknesses:** Less versatile than science or commercial wonders

**2. Stonehenge (United Kingdom)**

**Historical Context (Fact-Checked):**
- **Construction Period:** ~3000-2000 BCE (Neolithic period)
- **Location:** Wiltshire, England
- **Purpose:** Debated-astronomical calendar, religious site, burial ground
- **Status:** Well-preserved, UNESCO World Heritage Site
- **Note:** Predates ancient Seven Wonders by ~2000+ years!

- **B Side Ability:** Bonus resources each turn (economic engine)
- **Strategic Profile:**
  * Economic powerhouse
  * Enables resource-intensive strategies
  * Reduces dependency on neighbors for resources

- **Stage Benefits:**
  * Stage 1: Single resource per turn
  * Stage 2: Choice of resources each turn
  * Stage 3: Multiple resources + victory points

**Strategic Considerations:**
- **When to Choose:** When neighbors have conflicting resources, resource-scarce seating
- **Synergies:** Commercial (yellow) cards, guilds requiring diverse builds
- **Playstyle:** Economic engine, enables "tall" building strategy

**3. Abu Simbel (Egypt, أبو سمبل)**

**Historical Context (Fact-Checked):**
- **Construction Period:** 13th century BCE (~1264-1244 BCE)
- **Builder:** Pharaoh Ramesses II (Ramesses the Great)
- **Location:** Southern Egypt, near modern Sudan border
- **Famous Feature:** Four colossal statues of Ramesses II (20m/66ft tall)
- **Modern History:** Relocated 1964-1968 to avoid flooding from Aswan Dam
- **Status:** UNESCO World Heritage Site

**Game Mechanics:**
- **A Side Ability:** Leader entombment (requires Leaders expansion)
- **B Side Ability:** Alternative scoring mechanism for leaders
- **Strategic Profile:**
  * **Requires:** Leaders expansion (sold separately)
  * Rewards leader-focused strategies
  * Victory points for entombed leaders
- **Resource Requirements:** Stone-heavy (thematic for Egyptian temple)

**Strategic Considerations:**

- **Synergies:** Leader cards, guilds rewarding diverse Age buildings
- **Limitation:** Essentially useless without Leaders expansion

> **Important Note:** Abu Simbel's full potential requires the **Leaders expansion** (sold separately, ~$29.99). Without Leaders, it functions as a standard wonder with reduced abilities. Only choose if you own both expansions!

**4. Manneken Pis (Belgium, Brussels)**

**Historical Context (Fact-Checked):**
- **Creation:** 1618-1619 (current statue)
- **Location:** Brussels, Belgium
- **Height:** 61 cm (24 inches) - it's tiny!
- **Cultural Significance:** Symbol of Brussels' rebellious spirit

**Game Mechanics:**
- **Humorous Addition:** Intentionally whimsical wonder
- **A Side Ability:** Wildcard resource generation (mimics neighbors)
- **B Side Ability:** Flexible scoring based on opponents' strategies
- **Strategic Profile:**

**Player Count Impact:**

- ✅ **Beautiful Artwork:** Maintains 7 Wonders' high visual standard
- ✅ **Enhanced Replayability:** More wonder combinations = fresher games
- ✅ **Low Cost:** $10-15 for significant variety increase

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Learning Curve:** New players may find additional wonders overwhelming

- ❌ **Compatibility Complexity:** Mixing 1st and 2nd edition components can confuse
- ❌ **Limited Impact:** Just wonders-no new cards, mechanics, or guilds

## Strategy Deep Dive: Mastering Each Game

### 7 Wonders: Architects Strategy

**Core Principles:**

1. **Watch Your Neighbors:** Always know what resources they need-hate-draft critical cards
2. **Balance Resources:** Don't over-commit to one resource type
3. **Military Timing:** Strike when neighbors are weak militarily
4. **Science Efficiency:** Collect sets for progress tokens, use tactically
5. **Wonder Completion:** Build stages when efficient (don't hoard resources unnecessarily)

**Wonder-Specific Tips:**

- **Pyramids (Giza):** Focus stone gathering early, military secondary
- **Lighthouse (Alexandria):** Gold is king-use flexibility for key resources
- **Colossus (Rhodes):** Aggressive military, force early conflicts
- **Hanging Gardens (Babylon):** Science focus, progress token combos
- **Temple of Artemis (Ephesus):** Economic engine, outbuild opponents
- **Statue of Zeus (Olympia):** Balanced approach, react to opponents
- **Mausoleum (Halicarnassus):** Science/culture hybrid, flexible victory

### 7 Wonders: Duel + Pantheon Strategy

**Core Victory Paths:**

**1. Military Victory:**
- **Requirement:** Push conflict token to opponent's capital
- **Strategy:** Consistent shield accumulation, deny opponent military cards
- **Gods:** Ishtar, Mars (military boosts)
- **Risk:** Opponent can counter with defensive gods or pivot to science

**2. Scientific Victory:**
- **Requirement:** Collect 6 different scientific symbols (pairs)
- **Strategy:** Prioritize green cards, use progress tokens for science
- **Gods:** Athena, Enki (science acceleration)
- **Risk:** Opponent can hate-draft science cards, military pressure

**3. Civilian Victory (Points):**
- **Requirement:** Most victory points at game end
- **Strategy:** Balanced approach, blue buildings, wonders, guilds
- **Gods:** Ra (gold), Isis (resources) for economic engine
- **Risk:** Slower than military/science, vulnerable to focused opponents

**Pantheon-Specific Strategy:**

- **Divinity Token Economy:** Save for high-impact gods (Zeus, Athena) vs spending early
- **God Summoning Priority:** 
  1. Deny opponent's critical god
  2. Summon synergistic god for your strategy
  3. General utility gods
- **Snake Token Timing:** Use to block opponent's god right before their turn
- **Mythology Card Decisions:** Immediate effect vs future summoning potential

### 7 Wonders (Original) Strategy

**Card Drafting Mastery:**

1. **Hate Drafting:** Denying opponents > building yourself sometimes
2. **Resource Chains:** Free buildings from previous cards (critical efficiency)
3. **Neighbor Dependency:** Build resources opponents lack (sell for gold)
4. **Guild Awareness:** Remember which guilds are in play for Age III planning

**Color-Focused Strategies:**

- **Brown/Gray (Resources):** Consistent economy, sell to neighbors
- **Blue (Civic):** Pure victory points, low risk
- **Red (Military):** Aggressive neighbor pressure, conflict victories
- **Green (Science):** High-risk/high-reward set collection
- **Yellow (Commercial):** Economic engine, gold generation
- **Purple (Guilds, Age III):** Endgame scoring based on tableaus

**Advanced Techniques:**

- **Card Counting:** Track which cards have been played (especially science)
- **Wonder Timing:** Build wonder stages when most efficient (not always ASAP)
- **Neighbor Reading:** Anticipate opponents' needs, cut off their strategies
- **Age III Planning:** Enter Age III with clear path to victory (science sets, military dominance, or point engine)

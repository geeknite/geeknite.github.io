Hello Geeknite readers! Today, we dive into the murky depths of one of the most popular Citadel shades, **Agrax Earthshade**. Is it everything your miniatures need to go from 'meh' to 'marvelous'? Or does it fall short? Grab your brushes and let's find out!

## The Basics

Agrax Earthshade is a staple in the Warhammer painting community. This shade is designed to add depth and shadow to your models, giving them a more realistic and detailed appearance. It's like giving your miniatures a crash course in mood lighting!

## Application

Applying Agrax Earthshade is as simple as dipping a brush into the pot and slathering it over your model. But beware, it's easy to go overboard and drown your poor miniature in a sea of brown. Trust me, I've seen it happen (RIP, my first attempts). The trick is to apply it sparingly and let it settle into the recesses.

### Pro Tip

To avoid the 'muddy look,' use a damp brush to remove excess shade from raised areas. This helps maintain contrast and keeps your model looking sharp. You can thank me later.

## Versatility

One of the great things about Agrax Earthshade is its versatility. Whether you're painting space marines, orc warriors, or even the latest addition to your grimdark collection, this shade works wonders. It's like the Swiss Army knife of the painting world.

## Drying Time

Here's where patience is a virtue—Agrax Earthshade needs time to dry. The good news is that once it's dry, your model will look like it has emerged from the depths of a grimdark story. The bad news? You'll be tapping your foot waiting for it to finish drying.

## Comparisons

So, how does Agrax Earthshade stack up against other shades? Let's take a look:

### Nuln Oil

[Nuln Oil]({%- post_url nuln-oil-review.md -%}) is another popular shade from Citadel. While it's great for adding shadows, it lacks the warm, earthy tones of Agrax Earthshade. Think of it as the 'cooler cousin' in the shade family.

### Reikland Fleshshade

[Reikland Fleshshade]({%- post_url reikland-fleshshade-review.md -%}) offers a more reddish-brown hue, making it ideal for skin tones, but it doesn't quite capture the grittiness of Agrax Earthshade. It's like comparing apples to oranges—or in this case, shadows to skin tones.

## Conclusion

Overall, Agrax Earthshade is a must-have for any miniature painter. It adds depth, enhances details, and brings your models to life. Just remember, a little goes a long way. Now, go forth and shade like a pro!

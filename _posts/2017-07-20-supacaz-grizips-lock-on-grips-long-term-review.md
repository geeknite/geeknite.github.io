***Supacaz***, short for *super casual*, is a California brand best known for their bar tape and grips, they also make other accessories like bottle cages and drink bottles. [Supacaz's bar tape]({{ site.constants[0].wsib }}/supacaz%20bar%20tape) is used for many World Tour teams with names like Kittel or *Rockstar* Peter Sagan.

Today we are writing about the [Supacaz Grizips]({{ site.constants[0].wsib }}/Supacaz%20Grizips) lock on grips with a **special edition** with a grip in neon purple and the other in neon orange. Their products are known for their flashing and retro colors and this special edition grips are no exception.

The grizips feature the *Supacaz* starred logo and letters as the grip pattern, those grips are only one sided lock on collar, so the irritating moving end cap won't be necessary but in the other hand **these grips tend to rip on the bar end** if you fail to lean your bike in a secure surface and falls with the bar facing down. The one sided lock on collar is enough and only minimal torsion will be felt on really strong force.

Those are sized at 130mm and weight 115gr the pair, with bolts included. Also offered in many colors, this being the only with unmatched colors. The package includes 2 sets of collars detailed with the *Supacaz* logo, on black and chrome, to suit best your bike.

Quality in this grips are something noted on the first touch, lifespan and grip are also noted, these are a good smart shopping option if you could find a good offer because they are usually pretty expensive at $20 RRP.

After more than 1 year with them the only problem, apart from the holed end part, this color combination tends gets dirty, not so much as white grips but of course less than dark ones, **when buying grips is recommendable to get dark colored ones** if you are not so concerned about looks and more with practicality.

### Should I buy them?

**Pros:**

- If you are concerned about grip and looks not so much about weight
- For its quality and lifespan

**Cons:**

- Not cheap
- Lack of end cap protection

**Alternatives:**

- If you are in for lock on grips there are [cheaper alternatives]({{ site.constants[0].wsib }}/us/lock%20on%20grips)
- If you are in for really gripy grips check the [Odi X-treme Lock on grips]({%- post_url 2016-06-14-odi-x-treme-lock-on-grips-long-term-review -%})
- If you are most interested in comfort without losing grip you can opt for [foam grips]({{ site.constants[0].wsib }}/us/foam%20grips)

**Update 2021-05-16**: After a lot of quite intensive use, the rubber has deteriorated, leaving a sticky material that is not pleasant to the touch. We can say that they have reached the end of their useful life.

### The Basics

In Bloodborne: The Board Game, players work together to explore tiles, fight enemies, and complete objectives. Each player controls a unique Hunter, each with their own abilities and weapons. The goal is to survive the night, defeat bosses, and uncover the hidden secrets of Yharnam.

### Components

The game comes with:
- **Miniatures**: Beautifully crafted miniatures of Hunters, enemies, and bosses. Seriously, they're so detailed you might want to display them proudly on your shelf.
- **Cards**: Each Hunter has a deck of cards representing their abilities, actions, and special powers.
- **Game Board**: Various tiles that form the city of Yharnam, where battles and missions take place.
- **Tokens and Markers**: Used to track progress, health, and various effects during the game.

**Pro Tip**: Keep your miniatures away from the cat. Those claws are the real bosses here.

### Combat

Combat in Bloodborne is a blend of strategy and luck. Each enemy has unique mechanics that add challenges and twists to the game. Did you plan an epic combo just to have the enemy dodge? Welcome to Yharnam, where plans often go awry.

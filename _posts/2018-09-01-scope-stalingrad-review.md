## The Basics

### What is SCOPE Stalingrad?

SCOPE Stalingrad is a hidden movement and strategy board game that puts players in the shoes of a sniper in the Battle of Stalingrad. Designed to recreate the tension and strategic depth of sniper warfare, one player takes on the role of the sniper, while others control the soldiers trying to hunt them down.

### Components

The artwork is top-notch, and the components are built to last, ensuring that your strategic battles can continue for years to come.

## Gameplay

### Setting Up

Setup involves the sniper player secretly planning their moves on a hidden board. Meanwhile, the soldiers are positioned on the main board, ready to start their hunt. The sniper’s objective is to complete their mission without being detected, while the soldiers must cooperate to locate and capture the sniper.

### Turn Phases

Each turn consists of several phases:

1. **Action Phase**: Players perform actions such as moving, attacking, or using special abilities.

### Stealth and Strategy

The game shines in its strategic depth. As the sniper, you must carefully plan your moves, utilize cover, and think several steps ahead to outwit the soldiers. For the soldier players, cooperation and deduction are key. You'll need to communicate effectively, share information, and anticipate the sniper's tactics to corner them successfully.

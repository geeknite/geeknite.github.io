## Introduction

Good day, zombie hunters! Today, we’re diving into the grim, gutsy world of **Zombicide: Lost Zombivors**. If you’ve ever wondered what it’s like to fight zombies, lose friends to infection, and then fight those friends as zombies, boy, do we have the game for you. Get ready for a hilarious and thrilling journey through this zombified board game!

## The Basics

### What is Zombicide: Lost Zombivors?

Zombicide: Lost Zombivors is an expansion to the popular Zombicide game series. It introduces new elements, including zombified versions of hero characters (Zombivors), new missions, and more chaos. It’s like your favorite zombie movie, but with more friends turning into zombies and fewer popcorn spills.

### Components

The game comes with beautifully crafted miniatures, including the Zombivors, new tiles depicting post-apocalyptic locations, and a plethora of cards for equipment, events, and zombies. The artwork is top-notch, and the components are durable enough to survive even the most intense, snack-filled game nights.

**Fun Fact**: The Zombivors miniatures are so detailed, you might start feeling sympathy for their undead plight. Or not. They’re zombies, after all.

## Gameplay

### Setting Up

Setting up Zombicide: Lost Zombivors is an adventure in itself. Place the tiles, distribute the zombie miniatures, and prepare your hero characters. Make sure you have enough space because this game takes up a substantial portion of your table (and your sanity).

### Turn Phases

Each turn consists of several phases:

1. **Action Phase**: Players perform actions such as moving, attacking, and searching for equipment.
2. **Zombie Phase**: Zombies move and attack. They’re relentless, just like your sibling when it comes to the last slice of pizza.
3. **Event Phase**: Draw event cards that can spawn more zombies or introduce new challenges. Because why not add more chaos?

### Winning and Losing

To win, players must complete their mission objectives before being overwhelmed by the zombie horde. If all heroes are killed or turned into Zombivors, it’s game over. Humanity’s last hope is gone. Bummer.

**Pro Tip**: Always have a “Molotov Cocktail” card handy. It’s the nearest thing to a ‘get out of jail free card’ in a zombie apocalypse.

## Zombicide Humor Factor

One of the best aspects of Zombicide: Lost Zombivors is the humor woven into the gameplay. From the absurd event cards to the over-the-top zombie attacks, there’s never a dull moment. You’ll find yourself laughing as much as strategizing.

**Funny Moment**: During one game, our hero tried to negotiate with the zombies using a “Peace Treaty” card. Spoiler: Zombies don’t care about treaties. They care about brains.

## Introduction

Welcome, fellow gamers, to the ultimate review of the most hilarious, moo-tastic board game ever created: **Herd Mentality**. If you’ve ever wanted to experience the thrill of fitting in, or the agony of standing out, then this game is perfect for you. Grab your friends, family, and a sense of humor – it's time to dive into the witty world of **Herd Mentality**.

## Gameplay

### Objective

The goal of **Herd Mentality** is simple: think like the herd and avoid being the black sheep. Players take turns answering questions, and the aim is to match your answers with the majority. If you’re successful, you’ll earn points and bask in the glory of groupthink. However, if your answer stands out, you’ll receive the dreaded pink cow – the black sheep of the game.

### Turns and Actions

Each round begins with a player drawing a question card. Questions range from the mundane to the downright absurd, such as “What’s the best ice cream flavor?” or “Name something you might find in a junk drawer.” Players write down their answers in secret, hoping to match with others. Once everyone has written their answers, they reveal them simultaneously.

### Scoring

If most players have the same answer, they earn points. The oddball who doesn’t fit in gets the pink cow. The game continues until someone reaches the predetermined points to win, or everyone has laughed themselves into oblivion.

## The Humor Factor

### The Great Moo-ments

**Herd Mentality** is designed to be light-hearted and funny. The real joy comes from the laughter and surprise when answers are revealed. You’ll be amazed at how your friends think, and sometimes, you’ll question their sanity.

**Funny Moment**: During one game, our group had to answer, “Name a fruit that isn’t round.” Most players wrote “banana,” but one brave soul wrote “watermelon” – instant pink cow! The laughter echoed for hours.

The questions in **Herd Mentality** are crafted to be humorous and thought-provoking. Expect to encounter silly, unexpected answers that will leave you in stitches. The game encourages players to embrace their inner comedian, resulting in a night filled with laughter and fun.

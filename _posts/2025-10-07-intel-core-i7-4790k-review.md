Greetings, Geeknite readers! Today, we take a trip down memory lane with a review of the **Intel Core i7-4790K**, affectionately known as "Devil's Canyon." This CPU was once the darling of gamers and productivity enthusiasts alike. But does it still have what it takes to power your rig in 2025, or is it a relic better suited for a museum? Grab your RGB-lit hoverboard, and let's find out!

## **Introduction**

The Intel Core i7-4790K, released way back in 2014, was part of Intel's Haswell Refresh lineup. Sporting four cores and eight threads, it promised great performance for both gaming and productivity tasks. But it's 2025 now, and technology has advanced faster than the speed of a USB 4.0 transfer. Can this oldie still deliver?

## **Specifications**

Let's reminisce about the specs:

- **Architecture**: Haswell
- **Cores/Threads**: 4/8
- **Base Clock**: 4.0 GHz
- **Boost Clock**: 4.4 GHz
- **TDP**: 88W
- **L3 Cache**: 8MB
- **Memory Support**: DDR3-1600
- **PCIe Version**: 3.0

Impressive for its time, right? But how does it stack up against modern CPUs?

## **Performance**

### **Gaming Performance**

In gaming benchmarks, the i7-4790K can still hold its own against mid-range CPUs. Titles like *Cyberpunk 2077* and *Call of Duty: Warzone* run decently at 1080p with medium settings. But let's not kid ourselves—you're not going to hit those ultra settings without a well-endowed GPU to back it up.

### **Productivity Performance**

For productivity tasks, the i7-4790K is like that reliable old pair of jeans. Whether you're editing videos, rendering 3D models, or juggling multiple virtual machines, this CPU can handle it. Sure, it won't win any speed contests against the latest Ryzen or Intel models, but it gets the job done.

## **Thermals and Power Consumption**

One of the quirks of the i7-4790K is its thirst for power. With a TDP of 88W, it's not the most efficient chip by today's standards. In our stress tests, it frequently hit temps over 80°C with the stock cooler. Investing in a decent aftermarket cooler is highly recommended unless you're fond of turning your PC into a space heater.

## **Price and Value**

In 2025, you can snag an i7-4790K for around $100 on second-hand markets. It's a bargain for those looking to build a budget-friendly rig or breathe new life into an aging system. While it won't compete with modern CPUs, it's a viable option for light gaming and productivity tasks.

## **The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly**

### **The Good**

- **Solid Performance**: Decent gaming and productivity performance for its age.
- **Price**: Affordable option for budget builds.

### **The Bad**

- **Efficiency**: High power consumption and thermals.
- **DDR3 Memory**: Limited to older DDR3 memory.

### **The Ugly**

- **Stock Cooler**: The included cooler is about as effective as a wet paper towel. Invest in a better one.

## **Conclusion**

The Intel Core i7-4790K is a classic CPU that still holds some charm in 2025. While it won't blow away the latest processors, it's a solid choice for budget-conscious builders and retro enthusiasts. Pair it with a decent GPU and cooler, and you'll have a respectable system without emptying your wallet.

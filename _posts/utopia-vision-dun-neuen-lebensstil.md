The print quality is top-notch, with sharp details and a finish that screams sophistication.

**Funny Moment:** I once had a guest who stared at the wall art for a good five minutes before asking if it was a map of some futuristic utopian city. I told them, “No, it's just art,” but secretly wished they were right!

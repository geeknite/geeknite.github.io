Welcome, Geeknite readers, to this hilarious and detailed review of the Blu-ray release of *La Course vers El Dorado*. We're diving into the animated world created by DreamWorks, but is it truly a golden experience or just fool's gold? Grab some popcorn, a comfy seat, and let's embark on this journey together!

## The Movie: A Quick Recap

*La Course vers El Dorado*, or *The Road to El Dorado* for our non-francophone friends, is a 2000 animated adventure film by DreamWorks. It follows the misadventures of two charming rogues, Tulio and Miguel, as they stumble upon the legendary city of gold, El Dorado.

### Plot Summary

The story kicks off with Tulio and Miguel winning a map to El Dorado in a dice game (totally not rigged, right?). After escaping from the clutches of the Spanish army, they set sail for the New World, only to find themselves shipwrecked. Eventually, they discover El Dorado, where they are mistaken for gods by the local inhabitants.

Cue the hilarity, deception, and a bit of romance, as our heroes try to keep up the godly charade, dodge the scheming high priest Tzekel-Kan, and ultimately decide between the gold or their newfound friendships.

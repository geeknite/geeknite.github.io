## What is Azul?

Azul is a tile-placement game designed by Michael Kiesling and published by Plan B Games in 2018. Inspired by the intricate and beautiful Moorish tiles of Portugal, players take on the roles of artisans tasked with decorating the Royal Palace of Evora. The game combines stunning visuals with strategic depth, making it a hit among both casual and seasoned gamers.

### Components

The game comes with:
- **Tiles**: Gorgeous resin tiles in five different colors and patterns. Seriously, these tiles are so pretty you'll want to use them as coasters.
- **Player Boards**: Each player gets a board to arrange their tiles and track their score.
- **Factories**: Cardboard circles where tiles are drawn and placed at the start of each round.
- **Score Trackers**: Little cubes to keep track of your points.
- **Bag**: A bag to draw tiles from, adding a delightful element of randomness.
- **Rulebook**: Clear and concise, but you'll still end up house-ruling something. It’s a board game tradition!

**Pro Tip**: Keep an eye on those tiles. They have a sneaky way of disappearing into your couch cushions.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up Azul is a breeze. Place the factories in the center of the table, fill the bag with tiles, and draw tiles to place on each factory. Give each player a board, a score tracker, and you're ready to go!

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players take turns drafting tiles from the factories or the center of the table. You can only take tiles of the same color from a factory, and the rest go to the center. Once all tiles are taken, players arrange their tiles on their boards, aiming to complete rows and columns for points.

### Scoring

Scoring in Azul is straightforward but requires strategic planning. You score points for tiles placed in rows and columns, with bonus points for completing lines or using all tiles of a certain color. But beware! Any tiles you can't place will count as negative points.

## The Azul Experience

### Strategy and Depth

The beauty of Azul lies in its simplicity and depth. While the rules are easy to learn, mastering the game requires strategic thinking and careful planning. Should you complete that row now, or wait for a better tile? Can you force your opponent into taking unwanted tiles? Every decision matters.

**Funny Moment**: During one game, a friend was so focused on completing a row that they didn't notice the pile of negative points accumulating in their penalty area. The look on their face when they realized was priceless, and we all had a good laugh.

### Aesthetic Appeal

Azul is undoubtedly one of the most visually appealing games out there. The tiles are vibrant, the player boards are beautifully designed, and even the factories are aesthetically pleasing. This game is a feast for the eyes, and you'll find yourself admiring the components even as you're plotting your next move.

### Replayability

With multiple strategies to explore and different tile placements each game, Azul offers high replayability. No two games are ever the same, ensuring that you'll want to come back for more.

**Expansion Alert**: If you can't get enough of Azul, check out the expansions like Azul: Stained Glass of Sintra and Azul: Summer Pavilion. They add new mechanics and challenges to keep the game fresh and exciting.

## The Basics

In **Harmonies**, players take on the role of nature architects, arranging tiles to create the most harmonious landscapes possible. Your objective? Score points by aligning habitats and placing animals in their ideal environments. Think of it as the less chaotic alternative to those intense city planning meetings.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players draw tiles and place them on their personal boards. The tiles depict various habitats like forests, rivers, and mountains, along with animals that thrive in those environments. The trick is to match habitats and place animals in ways that score the highest points.

### Thematic Depth

The game's nature theme isn't just for show—it's an integral part of the experience. The artwork is stunning, with each tile depicting lush landscapes that make you want to ditch your real-life concrete jungle for a cabin in the woods. And let's be honest, who doesn't want to create a perfect forest habitat, only to realize they've locked themselves out of placing their remaining animals? It's the board game equivalent of painting yourself into a corner.

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Strategic Depth

Harmonies offers layers of strategy that keep players engaged. Each tile placement creates new opportunities and challenges, requiring forward-thinking and adaptability. The game excels in creating those satisfying "aha!" moments, similar to the ones experienced in our [Bluegrass Rogue Helmet Review]({%- post_url 2023-07-18-bluegrass-rogue-helmet-review -%}).

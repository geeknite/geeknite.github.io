## Introduction

Welcome, fellow board game enthusiasts! Today, we're diving into the vibrant and strategic world of **Azul: Stained Glass of Sintra**. If you're a fan of the original Azul, you're in for a treat. This sequel takes the beloved tile-placement mechanics and adds a shimmering twist that will have you reaching for those colorful tiles time and time again.

## What is Azul: Stained Glass of Sintra?

Azul: Stained Glass of Sintra is a standalone sequel to the award-winning Azul board game. Designed by Michael Kiesling, this version transports players to the palace of Sintra, where they work as artisans to create stunning stained glass windows. The game features beautiful components, strategic depth, and enough player interaction to keep everyone engaged.

## Components

The game comes with:
- **Glass tiles in various colors**: These tiles are used to create your masterpieces and are the heart of the game.
- **Player boards**: Representing the windows you're trying to complete.
- **A central board**: Where tiles are drawn from.
- **Scoring markers, a glazier pawn, and other necessary tokens**.

**Fun Fact**: The tiles look so delicious you might be tempted to eat them. Please don't.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setup is straightforward. Each player receives a player board, a scoring marker, and a glazier pawn. The central board is placed in the middle, and tiles are drawn and placed on the factories.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players take turns drafting tiles from the factories or the central board to place them on their player boards. The goal is to complete rows on your windows to score points. The twist? Your glazier can only move in one direction, so planning your moves carefully is key.

### Scoring

Scoring in Azul: Stained Glass of Sintra is a mix of immediate and end-game points. Completing rows and columns, as well as achieving specific patterns, will net you points. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

**Pro Tip**: Keep an eye on your opponents' boards and draft tiles that can block their progress or force them into unfavorable moves.

## The Shiny Bits

### Visual Appeal

One of the most striking aspects of Azul: Stained Glass of Sintra is its visual appeal. The translucent tiles catch the light beautifully, making the game as enjoyable to look at as it is to play.

### Strategic Depth

While the game retains the simple yet engaging mechanics of the original Azul, the addition of the glazier pawn and the unique player boards adds a new layer of strategy. You'll need to think several moves ahead and adapt to the changing board state.

**Memorable Moment**: In our last game, one player managed to score a massive combo by completing multiple rows in one turn, leaving the rest of us in awe and a bit of envy.

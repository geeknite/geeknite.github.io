Welcome, fellow board game enthusiasts! Today, we're diving deep into the world of bicycle racing with the spectacular **Flamme Rouge: Grand Tour**. If you're a fan of board games that simulate high-stakes races, strategic drafting, and managing your cyclist's energy levels, then buckle up (or should I say, pedal up), because this game is for you!

## What is Flamme Rouge: Grand Tour?

**Flamme Rouge: Grand Tour** is an expansion of the well-loved game [Flamme Rouge]({{ site.constants.wsib }}/flamme-rouge). It takes the original bicycle racing game and expands it to a tour-style campaign, where players compete in a series of stages, much like the actual grand tours like the Tour de France.

### Base Game Mechanics

The core mechanics of Flamme Rouge are simple yet elegantly strategic. Each player controls a team of two cyclists, a rouleur and a sprinteur, and must manage their energy levels using a deck of movement cards. The goal is to cross the finish line first, but the journey is fraught with tactical decisions:

- **Drafting**: Stay close behind other riders to conserve energy.
- **Exhaustion**: Push too hard, and you'll draw exhaustion cards that slow you down.
- **Terrain**: Navigate varied track layouts that include climbs and descents.

## The Grand Tour Expansion

### New Features

The **Grand Tour expansion** brings several exciting new elements to the game:

1. **Campaign Mode**: Players can now participate in a series of races, each affecting the next. Think of it as a mini Tour de France on your tabletop!
2. **New Tracks**: Additional track pieces allow for more varied and challenging courses, including cobblestones and longer stages.
3. **Stage Effects**: Weather conditions and other stage-specific rules add a layer of unpredictability and realism.
4. **Team Management**: Handle your cyclists' conditions over multiple stages, making strategic decisions about when to push for a win or conserve energy for future races.

### How It Changes the Game

The Grand Tour expansion transforms Flamme Rouge from a single race sprint into a marathon of strategic planning. Now, every decision has lasting consequences. Should you burn out your sprinteur for a stage win, or keep them fresh for the final showdown? The campaign mode adds depth and replayability, making each game session unique.

## Expansions and Variants

Flamme Rouge already has a couple of expansions that integrate beautifully with Grand Tour:

- **Peloton**: This expansion introduces new riders and tactics. It includes rules for up to six players and adds more strategic depth with new rider abilities and tactics.
- **Meteo**: This weather expansion adds the unpredictability of rain, wind, and other weather conditions to your races. It can dramatically change the outcome of a stage, forcing players to adapt their strategies on the fly.

With the variety of track pieces, stage effects, and the unpredictability of other players' strategies, no two games are the same. The campaign mode further enhances replayability, offering a fresh experience with each tour.

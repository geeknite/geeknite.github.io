## Introduction

Welcome, Geeknite readers! Today, we're diving into the world of the Microsoft Xbox Series X. This console has been a staple for gamers since its release, but how does it hold up in 2025? Grab your controller, put on your headset, and let's get started!

## The Good

### Graphics and Performance

The Xbox Series X remains an absolute beast when it comes to graphics and performance. With 12 teraflops of processing power, it delivers stunning visuals and smooth gameplay. It's like having a mini supercomputer in your living room. Just don't ask it to do your taxes.

### Game Library

The Xbox boasts a game library that can make even the most seasoned gamer drool. From the latest AAA titles like *Halo Infinite* and *Forza Horizon 5* to indie gems like *Hades*, there's something for everyone. Whether you're into first-person shooters or farming simulators (yes, we see you, Stardew Valley fans), Xbox has got you covered.

### Backward Compatibility

One of the best features of the Xbox Series X is its backward compatibility. You can play your old favorites from previous Xbox generations. It's like a blast from the past, but without the outdated graphics.

### Online Services: Xbox Game Pass or Xbox Live Gold?

Xbox has doubled down on its online services, offering Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Live Gold. Here's the breakdown:

- **Xbox Game Pass**: Access to a huge library of games for a monthly fee. It's like Netflix, but you actually feel productive.
- **Xbox Live Gold**: Better stability in servers, monthly free games (that you might actually play), and discounts.

**The verdict?** If you love having a buffet of games at your fingertips, Xbox Game Pass is the way to go. But if you prefer a stable online experience and the occasional freebie, Xbox Live Gold won't disappoint【4:1†source】.

## The Bad

### Price

Let's be honest, the Xbox Series X isn't cheap. At $499, it's a significant investment. But hey, quality comes at a price. Just make sure to hide the receipt from your significant other.

### Storage

While the Xbox Series X offers 1TB of storage, it's surprising how quickly it fills up. Between game installations and updates, you'll find yourself needing more space. Time to invest in an external hard drive.【4:0†source】

## The Ugly

### The Design

The Xbox Series X looks like a mini fridge. Don't get us wrong, it's sleek and modern, but it's hard not to make the comparison. On the bright side, you can store your energy drinks next to your console for those late-night gaming sessions.

### Controller Battery Life

The Xbox controllers are great, but the battery life? Not so much. Get ready to stock up on AA batteries or invest in rechargeable ones. Either way, you'll be swapping batteries more often than you'd like.【4:0†source】

## Conclusion

Overall, the Xbox Series X is an excellent console. It offers fantastic performance, a vast game library, and backward compatibility. Sure, it has its downsides, but what console doesn't? If you're a dedicated gamer, this is a worthy investment.

### Objective

The objective of Waddle is simple: lead your team of penguins to victory by navigating through various obstacles, collecting fish, and outsmarting your opponents. But don't be fooled by the cute exterior; Waddle requires strategy, quick thinking, and a fair amount of luck.

### Setup

Setting up Waddle is as easy as sliding on ice. You'll have a game board, penguin pieces, fish tokens, and obstacle cards.

You're ready to waddle!

### Turns

Each player takes turns drawing an obstacle card and moving their penguins accordingly. The obstacle cards can range from simple icebergs to treacherous seals. Depending on the card drawn, players must navigate their penguins through or around these obstacles while trying to collect as many fish tokens as possible.

## Introduction

Welcome, fellow hobbyists and miniature painters! Today, we're diving into the bloody world of **Citadel Shade Carroburg Crimson**. If you've ever wanted your miniatures to look like they've just stepped out of a grisly battle, this is the paint for you. Join us as we explore why this shade deserves a spot in your paint collection.

## What is Citadel Shade Carroburg Crimson?

Citadel Shade Carroburg Crimson is a wash paint designed to add depth, shadows, and a touch of gore to your miniatures. With its excellent flow and rich crimson color, it brings out the details and textures beautifully. Whether you're painting Warhammer figures or any other miniatures, Carroburg Crimson adds a dramatic and bloody effect.

## The Basics

### Components

The paint comes in a 24ml bottle, which might sound small, but trust me, a little goes a long way. It has a smooth consistency and is easy to apply. The bottle design ensures minimal spillage, which is great because we all know how heartbreaking it is to waste even a drop of our precious paints.

### Application

Using Carroburg Crimson is a breeze. Simply shake the bottle, dip your brush, and apply the wash to your miniature. The paint flows into the recesses and crevices, creating natural-looking shadows and depth. It's perfect for blood effects, dark armor, or anything that needs a touch of crimson.

### Drying Time

The drying time is relatively quick, but if you're impatient like me, a hairdryer can speed things up. Just be careful not to melt your miniatures – plastic and fire are not friends.

## The Experience

### Why We Love It

One of the standout features of Carroburg Crimson is its versatility. Whether you're painting fantasy knights, sci-fi warriors, or zombies, this shade adds a dramatic flair. The rich red color is perfect for creating blood splatters, deep shadows, and battle-worn effects.

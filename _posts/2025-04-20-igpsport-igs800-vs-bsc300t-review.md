## **Design and Display: Style Meets Functionality**

*When it comes to design, it’s like choosing the perfect bike helmet – you want to look good while staying functional!*

- **iGS800**: With a 3.5" touchscreen and a resolution of 320 x 480, the iGS800 offers a vibrant and responsive display. Its sleek design screams premium, but its larger size (99 x 60 x 21 mm) and weight (<120g) might not suit everyone.
- **BSC300T**: Sporting a 2.4" touchscreen with a resolution of 240 x 320, the BSC300T is compact (82 x 53 x 14.1 mm) and lightweight (67g). While it’s not as flashy, its minimalist design is perfect for riders who prefer simplicity.

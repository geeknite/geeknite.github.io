## Introduction

Welcome back to Geeknite, where we dive deep into the world of tech gadgets and bring you the quirkiest reviews. Today, we're going to talk about a mouse that gives the Energizer Bunny a run for its money—the **Logitech M705**. This little critter claims to have a battery life so long you'd think it runs on nuclear power. So, let's find out if it really lives up to the hype.

## Design and Comfort

The Logitech M705 sports a sleek, ergonomic design that fits snugly into your hand, like it was made just for you. It's like the Cinderella slipper of mice, but without the midnight deadline. The curve and contours make it super comfy for prolonged use, perfect for those marathon coding sessions or intense gaming nights.

### Ergonomic Features

- **Contoured Shape:** Fits your hand like a glove—without the sweaty palms.
- **Rubber Grips:** Adds extra comfort for those long 'geek nights'.
- **Thumb Buttons:** Positioned just right for those quick back and forth web page navigations.

## Performance

Now, let's talk about performance. This mouse glides smoother than a hot knife through butter. Whether you're working on intricate designs or just scrolling through endless social media feeds, the Logitech M705 handles it like a champ.

### DPI Settings

- **1000 DPI:** Perfect for general use and those precision tasks.

### Hyper-fast Scrolling

You can scroll through pages faster than you can say "Geeknite." Great for those TL;DR moments.

## Battery Life

Ah, the pièce de résistance—the battery life. Logitech claims the M705 can last up to **three years** on a single pair of AA batteries. That's right, folks, three years. You could almost forget it needs batteries at all.

### Energy Efficiency

- **Auto Sleep Mode:** Saves battery life when you're not actively using the mouse.
- **On/Off Switch:** For those extra cautious geeks who switch off their tech every night.

## Connectivity

The M705 uses Logitech's Unifying Receiver, which means you can connect up to six compatible devices to one tiny USB dongle. It's like having a party where everyone fits into a matchbox.

### Wireless Range

- **10 meters:** So you can still use your mouse even if you’re dancing across the room.

## Comparison with Other Mice

### [Logitech MX Master 3]({% post_url 2025-03-14-logitech-mx-master-3-review %})
The MX Master 3 has advanced features and ergonomics but comes at a higher price. If you need the extra bells and whistles and can splurge, it's worth considering.

### [Razer DeathAdder V2]({% post_url 2025-06-07-razer-deathadder-v2-review %})
For gamers, the DeathAdder V2 offers higher DPI settings and customizable buttons but lacks the insane battery life.

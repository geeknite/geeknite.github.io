So grab your swords, put on your chainmail, and let's see if this game is worth conquering!

## What is The Last Kingdom Board Game?

The Last Kingdom Board Game is a tactical strategy game set in the turbulent world of 9th century England. Players take on the roles of various factions vying for control of the land, from Saxons to Danes. The game combines area control, resource management, and combat in a way that will make you feel like you're part of the show's epic struggle.

### Components

The game comes with:
- **Miniatures**: Detailed figures representing your warriors, leaders, and various other characters.
- **Cards**: Action, event, and character cards that drive the gameplay.
- **Game Board**: A map of England divided into various regions.
- **Tokens and Markers**: Used to track resources, control areas, and various effects during the game.

**Pro Tip**: Do not attempt to eat the tokens. They are not historically accurate meat pies.

## How to Play

### Setup

Setting up The Last Kingdom Board Game is almost as complex as forging alliances with unpredictable Vikings. Lay out the game board, distribute miniatures and cards, and choose your faction. Now you're ready to start your quest for dominance.

### Turns and Actions

Each turn, players can perform actions such as moving armies, attacking enemies, gathering resources, and forming alliances. The strategic depth is immense, and every decision can have far-reaching consequences. Just remember, trust no one—especially the player who keeps making "friendly" offers.

### Combat

Combat in The Last Kingdom Board Game is a mix of strategy and luck. Players use cards to enhance their forces and engage in battles to capture territories. The outcome of battles can swing wildly based on the cards played and the roll of the dice.

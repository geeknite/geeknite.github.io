## Introduction

Welcome, fellow keyboard warriors and typing enthusiasts! Today, we're diving deep into the clacky and tactile world of mechanical keyboards.

## The Basics: What is a Mechanical Keyboard?

- **Cherry MX Blue**: Clicky and tactile. Great for typing, not so much for your roommates.
- **Cherry MX Red**: Smooth and linear. Perfect for gaming, less so for your spelling errors.
- **Cherry MX Brown**: Tactile and quiet. The best of both worlds.
- **Razer Green**: Clicky and tactile. Razer's answer to Cherry MX Blue, with a bit more actuation force.
- **Gateron**: Affordable and smooth. Comes in various types, similar to Cherry MX.
